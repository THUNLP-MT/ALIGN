INFO - Agent Action: Since the microwave is already at my current location and I've placed the mug inside, the issue seems to be that I need to specify the object to be heated. However, the correct action format for using the microwave to heat an object is not directly provided. Given the available actions, a more appropriate step would be to open the microwave again to check its contents, but since the task is to heat the mug, let's try to use the microwave with the mug as the object being heated, which aligns with the task's requirement.
