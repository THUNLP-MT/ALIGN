Since the environment is not responding as expected, let's try a different approach by simplifying the steps further:

go to fridge 1
open fridge 1
cool mug 3 with fridge 1 interior
close fridge 1
wait 5 minutes
go to fridge 1
open fridge 1
take mug 3 from fridge 1 interior

Let's try one more time without waiting, as the environment might not be recognizing the wait action.

go to fridge 1
open fridge 1
cool mug 3 with fridge 1 interior

Since the environment is not responding as expected, let's try a direct approach:

go to fridge 1

Since the direct approach is also not working, let's try a different object to ensure the environment is responding correctly:

go to countertop 1
