INFO - Agent Action: open cabinet 1
INFO - Observation: You might be too far away to open the cabinet 1. Try moving closer first, for example using 'go to cabinet 1'.
INFO - Reward: False
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I am already at cabinet 1, but it seems I need to reconfirm my proximity, however, the issue seems to be that I need to actually interact with the cabinet to open it, so I should try to take something from it or examine it to see if that works, but first let me try to open it again as I am already at the location.
ACTION: open cabinet 1
INFO - Agent Action: open cabinet 1
INFO - Observation: You might be too far away to open the cabinet 1. Try moving closer first, for example using 'go to cabinet 1'.
INFO - Reward: False
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Despite being told I'm at cabinet 1, the environment suggests I'm too far to open it, implying a need to reaffirm proximity or interaction, so I'll try going to it again to ensure I'm as close as possible.
ACTION: go to cabinet 1
INFO - Agent Action: go to cabinet 1
INFO - Observation: Could not move to the cabinet 1. You might already be there or there might be an issue moving there. Try 'look' to confirm your location or try moving elsewhere first.

INFO - Observation: On the cabinet 1, you see a plate 1, and a vase 1.
INFO - Reward: False
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since examining the cabinet 1 showed a plate and a vase but no saltshaker, and I still need to put a saltshaker on a cabinet, I should try opening the cabinet to see if the saltshaker is inside, as the examination didn't provide access to the interior.
ACTION: open cabinet 1
INFO - Agent Action: open cabinet 1
INFO - Observation: You might be too far away to open the cabinet 1. Try moving closer first, for example using 'go to cabinet 1'.

ACTION: go to cabinet 2
INFO - Agent Action: go to cabinet 2
INFO - Observation: You arrive at cabinet 2. The cabinet 2 is closed.
INFO - Reward: False
INFO - Done: False

INFO - Agent Action: examine cabinet 3
INFO - Observation: On the cabinet 3, you see nothing.
INFO - Reward: False
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------

ACTION: go to countertop 1
INFO - Agent Action: go to countertop 1
INFO - Observation: You arrive at countertop 1. On the countertop 1, you see a apple 1, a bowl 1, a pan 1, and a soapbottle 1.
INFO - Reward: False
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
