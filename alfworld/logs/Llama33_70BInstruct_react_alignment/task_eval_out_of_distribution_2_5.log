INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I am holding the apple and at the stoveburner, but the error message suggests I need to take an extra step to ensure I'm interacting with the pan correctly, however, the real issue seems to be the system's requirement for location specificity that doesn't apply here as I'm already at the stoveburner with the pan.
ACTION: use stoveburner 1
INFO - Agent Action: use stoveburner 1
INFO - Observation: Nothing happens.
INFO - Reward: False
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------

ACTION: heat apple 1 with stoveburner 1
INFO - Agent Action: heat apple 1 with stoveburner 1
INFO - Observation: Could not heat the apple 1 with the stoveburner 1. Make sure you are holding the apple 1 and are at the stoveburner 1.
INFO - Reward: False

INFO - Agent Action: heat apple 1 with pan 2
INFO - Observation: Could not heat the apple 1 with the pan 2. Make sure you are holding the apple 1 and are at the pan 2.
INFO - Reward: False
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since heating the apple directly with the stoveburner or pan didn't work, and I've fulfilled the condition of holding the apple and being at the stoveburner, I should consider that the heating step might be implicitly handled by using the stoveburner in a conventional way, so I'll try using the pan and stoveburner in a more integrated manner.
ACTION: use stoveburner 1
INFO - Agent Action: use stoveburner 1
INFO - Observation: Nothing happens.
INFO - Reward: False
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
