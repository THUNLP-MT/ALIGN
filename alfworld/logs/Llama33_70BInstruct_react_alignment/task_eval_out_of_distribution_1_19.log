INFO - Agent Action: look
INFO - Observation: You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you see nothing.
INFO - Reward: False
INFO - Done: False

ACTION: examine soapbottle 1
INFO - Agent Action: examine soapbottle 1
INFO - Observation: You might be too far away to examine the soapbottle 1. Try moving closer first, for example using 'go to soapbottle 1'.
INFO - Reward: False
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since I'm too far to examine the soapbottle 1 directly, I should move closer to it, but given the environment rules, I should instead go to the receptacle or surface where the soapbottle 1 is located, which is countertop 1, and I'm already there, so I need to rethink my approach to finding the cloth.
ACTION: go to cabinet 1
INFO - Agent Action: go to cabinet 1
INFO - Observation: You arrive at cabinet 1. The cabinet 1 is closed.
INFO - Reward: False
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------

INFO - Agent Action: open cabinet 1
INFO - Observation: You open the cabinet 1. The cabinet 1 is open. In it, you see a soapbottle 3.

ACTION: take soapbottle 3 from cabinet 1
INFO - Agent Action: take soapbottle 3 from cabinet 1
INFO - Observation: You pick up the soapbottle 3 from the cabinet 1.
INFO - Reward: False
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I have the soapbottle 3, which is a cleaning supply, but I still need to find the cloth to clean, so I should look for it in other locations, possibly near the sinkbasin where cleaning often takes place.
ACTION: go to sinkbasin 1
INFO - Agent Action: go to sinkbasin 1
INFO - Observation: You arrive at sinkbasin 1. On the sinkbasin 1, you see nothing.
INFO - Reward: False
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since there's nothing on the sinkbasin 1, I should check the surrounding area or other nearby locations, such as the handtowelholder, to see if the cloth I'm looking for is there.
ACTION: go to handtowelholder 1
INFO - Agent Action: go to handtowelholder 1
INFO - Observation: You arrive at handtowelholder 1. On the handtowelholder 1, you see nothing.
INFO - Reward: False
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The handtowelholder 1 is empty, so I should try another location that might have the cloth, such as the towelholder, which is often used to hold towels or other cloths.
ACTION: go to towelholder 1
INFO - Agent Action: go to towelholder 1
INFO - Observation: You arrive at towelholder 1. On the towelholder 1, you see a towel 1.
INFO - Reward: False
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------

INFO - Agent Action: take towel 1 from towelholder 1
INFO - Observation: Could not take the towel 1 from the towelholder 1. Make sure you are at the towelholder 1, it is open, and the towel 1 is inside.
INFO - Reward: False
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since I'm already at the towelholder 1 and the towel 1 is on it, not inside, I should be able to take it directly, but the error suggests I might need to reconsider my approach or ensure the towelholder is accessible, however, given it's a holder and not a closed container, I'll try again with the correct syntax.
ACTION: take towel 1 from towelholder 1
INFO - Agent Action: take towel 1 from towelholder 1
INFO - Observation: Could not take the towel 1 from the towelholder 1. Make sure you are at the towelholder 1, it is open, and the towel 1 is inside.
INFO - Reward: False
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The issue seems to be with the assumption that the towelholder 1 needs to be "open" to take the towel 1, but since it's a holder and not a container, I should simply take the towel 1 without specifying the source as "from towelholder 1".
ACTION: take towel 1
INFO - Agent Action: take towel 1
INFO - Observation: The action 'take towel 1' is not recognized or supported by the environment. Please use one of the documented action formats (e.g., 'go to ...', 'take ... from ...', 'move ... to ...', etc.).
INFO - Reward: False
INFO - Done: False
INFO - Log contents when executing `WrapStep`: WARNING - Agent action 'take towel 1' did not match any known patterns and is not a handled invalid pattern. Providing generic feedback.


INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Given the error and the need to use a documented action format, I should try taking the towel 1 from the towelholder 1 again, as it's the most logical action, but since that didn't work, I'll examine the towelholder 1 to see if that provides more information.
ACTION: examine towelholder 1
INFO - Agent Action: examine towelholder 1
INFO - Observation: On the towelholder 1, you see a towel 1.
INFO - Reward: False
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I've confirmed the towel 1 is on the towelholder 1, and I need to take it to clean it, so I'll try taking it from the towelholder 1 again, hoping the examination step somehow allows this action to succeed.
ACTION: take towel 1 from towelholder 1
INFO - Agent Action: take towel 1 from towelholder 1

INFO - Reward: False
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The error message suggests the towelholder 1 needs to be "open", but as a holder, it doesn't have an open or closed state, so I'll try a different approach by going back to the sinkbasin 1 where I can potentially clean the towel 1, and then figure out how to take it.

INFO - Agent Action: go to sinkbasin 1
INFO - Observation: You arrive at sinkbasin 1. On the sinkbasin 1, you see nothing.
INFO - Reward: False
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------

INFO - Agent Action: take towel 1 from towelholder 1

INFO - Reward: False
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The issue persists, and the error message is misleading since the towelholder 1 doesn't have an open or closed state, so I'll try a different approach by using the 'take' action without specifying the source, hoping it will work this time.

INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Given the constraints and the fact that I've already examined the towelholder 1 and seen the towel 1, I should reconsider my approach and try to clean the towel 1 without taking it, or find an alternative way to interact with it, but first, I need to ensure I have a way to clean it, which I do with the soapbottle 3.

INFO - Observation: You arrive at towelholder 1. On the towelholder 1, you see a towel 1.
INFO - Reward: False
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I have the soapbottle 3 and I'm at the towelholder 1 where the towel 1 is, so I should try to clean the towel 1 using the soapbottle 3, but the action to clean is not directly applicable to the towel 1 without taking it, and taking it hasn't worked, so I need to think of a way to use the soapbottle 3 and the sinkbasin 1 together to clean the towel 1.
ACTION: use soapbottle 3
INFO - Agent Action: use soapbottle 3
INFO - Observation: Nothing happens.
INFO - Reward: False
