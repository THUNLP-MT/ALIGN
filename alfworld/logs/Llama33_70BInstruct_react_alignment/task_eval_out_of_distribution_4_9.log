INFO - Observation: You arrive at desk 2. On the desk 2, you see a bowl 2, a bowl 1, a cd 2, a cd 1, and a creditcard 3.
INFO - Reward: False
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I've found bowls on desk 2, but my task is to look at the bowl under the desklamp, which was originally associated with desk 1, so I should return to desk 1 and try again or consider if there's a desklamp on desk 2 that I haven't noticed.
ACTION: go to desk 1
INFO - Agent Action: go to desk 1
INFO - Observation: You arrive at desk 1. On the desk 1, you see a alarmclock 1, a desklamp 1, a mug 1, and a pencil 1.

INFO - Agent Action: look
INFO - Observation: You are facing the desk 1. Next to it, you see nothing.
INFO - Reward: False
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
