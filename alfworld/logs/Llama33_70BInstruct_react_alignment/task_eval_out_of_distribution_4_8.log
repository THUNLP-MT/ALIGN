INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I've confirmed my location and seen that there's nothing next to desk 1, and I've tried various actions without finding the book or being able to examine it with the desklamp, so I should consider that the task might be impossible or that there's a hidden or indirect way to achieve it.
ACTION: use desklamp 1
INFO - Agent Action: use desklamp 1
INFO - Observation: You turn on the desklamp 1.
INFO - Reward: False

INFO - Reward: False
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: With the desklamp on, I've examined the desk and see the usual objects, but there's still no book, so I should consider if one of these objects could be used in a way that relates to a book or if the task is more abstract.
ACTION: use laptop 3
INFO - Agent Action: use laptop 3
INFO - Observation: Nothing happens.
INFO - Reward: False
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Using the laptop 3 didn't produce any results, and I've tried various actions with the objects on the desk, so I should think about the task in a more abstract or creative way, considering what "examining a book with a desklamp" could metaphorically mean.

INFO - Observation: You are facing the desk 1. Next to it, you see nothing.
INFO - Reward: False
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I've been unable to find a physical book or a way to examine one with the desklamp through conventional means, so I should consider if the task is actually impossible or if there's a highly unconventional solution that doesn't involve direct interaction with a physical book.
ACTION: turn off desklamp 1
INFO - Agent Action: turn off desklamp 1

INFO - Agent Action: go to shelf 1
INFO - Observation: You arrive at shelf 1. On the shelf 1, you see a bowl 1.
INFO - Reward: False
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------

ACTION: go to shelf 2
INFO - Agent Action: go to shelf 2
INFO - Observation: You arrive at shelf 2. On the shelf 2, you see a pen 1.
INFO - Reward: False
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------

INFO - Agent Action: use laptop 3
INFO - Observation: Nothing happens.
INFO - Reward: False
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Using the laptop 3 again didn't produce any results, and I've tried various actions with the objects on the desk, so I should think about the task in a more abstract or metaphorical way, considering what "examining a book with a desklamp" could represent.

INFO - Observation: You might be too far away to examine the desklamp 1. Try moving closer first, for example using 'go to desklamp 1'.
INFO - Reward: False
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------

INFO - Reward: False
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Shelf 3 has another desklamp, which is interesting since I already have one at desk 1, but there's still no book, so I should consider if there's something I can do with the two desklamps or if this is just a red herring.
ACTION: take desklamp 1 from shelf 3
INFO - Agent Action: take desklamp 1 from shelf 3
INFO - Observation: Could not take the desklamp 1 from the shelf 3. Make sure you are at the shelf 3, it is open, and the desklamp 1 is inside.
INFO - Reward: False

INFO - Reward: False
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------

INFO - Agent Action: use pen 1
INFO - Observation: Nothing happens.
INFO - Reward: False
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Using the pen 1 didn't produce any results, but I should consider that maybe I need to use it in combination with another object, like the laptop or a piece of paper, to create something that could be examined with the desklamp.

INFO - Reward: False
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Drawer 1 is open and contains a keychain, but no book, so I should consider if there's anything else I can do with the objects I've found or if there's a different approach to examining a book with the desklamp that doesn't involve a physical book.

INFO - Observation: You close the drawer 1.
INFO - Reward: False
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
