INFO - Reward: False

INFO - Reward: False
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I found a peppershaker, which is similar to a saltshaker, but I still need to find the actual saltshaker and the drawer, so I should examine the surrounding area or move to a nearby location that might have the saltshaker or the drawer.

INFO - Observation: You arrive at drawer 1. The drawer 1 is closed.

INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I am already at cabinet 1, but apparently, I need to be even closer or in a more specific position to interact with it, however, the system already confirmed I am at cabinet 1, so the next logical step is to try opening it again as the distance issue seems to be a misunderstanding.

INFO - ---------------------------------
