INFO - Reward: False

INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I need to move closer to the box 1 to examine it, but since I'm already at the sofa 1 where the box 1 is located, I should be able to interact with it directly, however, the system suggests moving closer, so I'll try going to the box 1.

INFO - ---------------------------------

INFO - Reward: False
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The issue seems to be that the sofa 1 needs to be "open" to take the keychain 2, but sofas can't be opened in the classical sense, so I'll try to think of the sofa 1 as a location that might need a different approach.
ACTION: look
INFO - Agent Action: look
INFO - Observation: You are facing the sofa 1. Next to it, you see nothing.
INFO - Reward: False
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I'm still having trouble taking the keychain 2 from the sofa 1, and I've already found one keychain, so I should try to approach the problem from a different angle, considering that I might need to use a different verb or action to pick up the keychain 2.

INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I've tried taking the keychain 2 from the sofa 1 multiple times, and the issue seems to be that the sofa 1 needs to be "open", which doesn't make sense for a sofa, so I'll try to open the box 1 on the sofa 1 to see if that helps.

INFO - Agent Action: open box 1
INFO - Observation: You might be too far away to open the box 1. Try moving closer first, for example using 'go to box 1'.

INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I'm already at the sofa 1 where the box 1 is located, but the system suggests moving closer, which implies that I need to be at the same location as the box 1 to interact with it, so I should try to go to the sofa 1 again to ensure I'm in the correct position.

INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I've tried taking the keychain 2 from the sofa 1 multiple times, and the issue seems to be that the sofa 1 needs to be "open", which is a contradictory concept for a sofa, so I'll try to approach the problem from a different angle, considering that the keychain 2 might be directly accessible.
