INFO - Observation: Could not take the keychain 2 from the dresser 1. Make sure you are at the dresser 1, it is open, and the keychain 2 is inside.
INFO - Reward: False
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The action failed, implying the dresser might not be open, so I should try to open the dresser first before attempting to take the keychain 2 again.
ACTION: open dresser 1
INFO - Agent Action: open dresser 1
INFO - Observation: You might be too far away to open the dresser 1. Try moving closer first, for example using 'go to dresser 1'.
INFO - Reward: False
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I need to ensure I am close enough to the dresser to interact with it, but since I was already at the dresser and picked up a keychain, I should reconfirm my location and then try to open it or take the keychain.
ACTION: go to dresser 1
INFO - Agent Action: go to dresser 1
INFO - Observation: Could not move to the dresser 1. You might already be there or there might be an issue moving there. Try 'look' to confirm your location or try moving elsewhere first.
INFO - Reward: False
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since I was already at the dresser and the move action failed, I should try to look around to confirm my location and the state of the dresser before attempting any other actions.
ACTION: look
INFO - Agent Action: look
INFO - Observation: You are facing the dresser 1. Next to it, you see nothing.
INFO - Reward: False
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I am confirmed to be at the dresser, and since I already have one keychain and see the other, I should attempt to take the second keychain directly without opening the dresser, as it's likely already accessible.
ACTION: take keychain 2 from dresser 1
INFO - Agent Action: take keychain 2 from dresser 1
INFO - Observation: Could not take the keychain 2 from the dresser 1. Make sure you are at the dresser 1, it is open, and the keychain 2 is inside.
INFO - Reward: False
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Given that I'm at the dresser and have previously taken an item from it, but now can't take the keychain 2, it's likely the dresser needs to be open to access its contents, so I should try opening it.
ACTION: open dresser 1
INFO - Agent Action: open dresser 1
INFO - Observation: You might be too far away to open the dresser 1. Try moving closer first, for example using 'go to dresser 1'.
INFO - Reward: False
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I've already established I'm at the dresser, but the system suggests I might be too far; however, given my previous actions, I believe the issue is not distance but rather the dresser being closed, so I'll try to open it again, but first, I should confirm if there's an actual distance issue by trying to move to it, which seems redundant but will follow the system's hint.
ACTION: go to dresser 1
INFO - Agent Action: go to dresser 1
INFO - Observation: Could not move to the dresser 1. You might already be there or there might be an issue moving there. Try 'look' to confirm your location or try moving elsewhere first.
INFO - Reward: False
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since moving to the dresser failed, indicating I'm likely already there, and previous attempts to open or take items also failed, I should try a different approach, such as examining the dresser to see if it provides any clues or if there's something specific I'm missing.
ACTION: examine dresser 1
INFO - Agent Action: examine dresser 1
INFO - Observation: On the dresser 1, you see a box 1, a creditcard 1, a keychain 2, a laptop 1, a statue 1, and a tissuebox 2.
INFO - Reward: False
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Examining the dresser shows the keychain 2 is still there, and since I've already taken keychain 1, my next step should be to find a way to take keychain 2, considering the dresser might need a specific action to access its contents properly.
ACTION: take keychain 2 from dresser 1
INFO - Agent Action: take keychain 2 from dresser 1
INFO - Observation: Could not take the keychain 2 from the dresser 1. Make sure you are at the dresser 1, it is open, and the keychain 2 is inside.
INFO - Reward: False
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------

ACTION: open dresser 1
INFO - Agent Action: open dresser 1
INFO - Observation: You might be too far away to open the dresser 1. Try moving closer first, for example using 'go to dresser 1'.
INFO - Reward: False
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The system suggests moving closer to open the dresser, but I've already established I'm at the dresser, so this message might be an error or a requirement for a specific action sequence, and since I've tried moving to it before with no success, I should try a different approach to interact with the dresser.
ACTION: look
INFO - Agent Action: look
INFO - Observation: You are facing the dresser 1. Next to it, you see nothing.
INFO - Reward: False
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I've confirmed I'm facing the dresser and can see it, so the issue with opening it or taking the keychain 2 isn't distance, and since previous attempts to open it directly have failed, I should consider if there's a specific sequence of actions or an alternative way to access the dresser's contents.

INFO - Agent Action: inventory
INFO - Observation: You are carrying: a keychain 1.
INFO - Reward: False
INFO - Done: False

INFO - Reward: False
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The system suggests I'm too far to examine the keychain 2, but since I'm already at the dresser where the keychain 2 is located, this message seems inconsistent with my current location, so I should try to move to a location that allows me to interact with the keychain 2 more directly.
ACTION: go to dresser 1
INFO - Agent Action: go to dresser 1

INFO - Reward: False
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since moving to the dresser failed, indicating I'm likely already there, and I've previously examined the dresser and seen the keychain 2, my next step should be to try and directly interact with the keychain 2 again, possibly by re-examining my approach to taking it.
ACTION: take keychain 2 from dresser 1
INFO - Agent Action: take keychain 2 from dresser 1
INFO - Observation: Could not take the keychain 2 from the dresser 1. Make sure you are at the dresser 1, it is open, and the keychain 2 is inside.
INFO - Reward: False

INFO - Reward: False
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I've confirmed I'm facing the dresser and it's likely I'm as close as I can be, so the issue with opening it or taking the keychain 2 must be something else, and since I've tried various actions, I should consider if there's a specific condition or sequence required to access the keychain 2.
ACTION: inventory
INFO - Agent Action: inventory
INFO - Observation: You are carrying: a keychain 1.
INFO - Reward: False
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I still only have one keychain, and my goal is to put two keychains in the safe, so I need to find a way to obtain the second keychain, and since direct actions on the dresser have failed, I should consider moving to a different location or trying a different approach.

INFO - Observation: You arrive at safe 1. The safe 1 is closed.
INFO - Reward: False
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I've arrived at the safe, but it's closed, which means I need to open it before I can put the keychains inside, and since I only have one keychain with me, I'll need to figure out how to get the second keychain after opening the safe or before putting the first one in.
ACTION: open safe 1
INFO - Agent Action: open safe 1
INFO - Observation: You open the safe 1. The safe 1 is open. In it, you see a statue 2, and a watch 3.
INFO - Reward: False
INFO - Done: False
