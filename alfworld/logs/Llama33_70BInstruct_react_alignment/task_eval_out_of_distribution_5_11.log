INFO - Agent Action: go to desk 1
INFO - Observation: You arrive at desk 1. On the desk 1, you see a alarmclock 2, a bowl 1, a desklamp 1, and a laptop 1.
INFO - Reward: False

INFO - Reward: False
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since I was already at desk 2 and the CD 2 is on it, not inside, the issue might be that the desk is not considered "open" or there's an implicit requirement to explicitly interact with the desk before taking the second item, but given the context, it's more likely the system is prompting for confirmation of location, so I should reconfirm my location.
ACTION: go to desk 2
INFO - Agent Action: go to desk 2
INFO - Observation: Could not move to the desk 2. You might already be there or there might be an issue moving there. Try 'look' to confirm your location or try moving elsewhere first.
INFO - Reward: False
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The system indicates I might already be at desk 2, which is likely the case since I just took a CD from it, so I should try to take the CD 2 again without changing location.

INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The error message suggests that the desk 2 needs to be "open", but since desks are typically not closed or open in the same way cabinets or drawers are, this might be a misunderstanding or a game mechanic requirement, so I'll try to explicitly open desk 2, even though it doesn't make real-world sense.
