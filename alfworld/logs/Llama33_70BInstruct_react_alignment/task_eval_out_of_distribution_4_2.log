Your task is to: look at cd under the desklamp.
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: To look at the cd under the desklamp, I first need to locate the desk where the desklamp is likely to be, so I should start by examining my surroundings more closely.
ACTION: look
INFO - Agent Action: look
INFO - Observation: You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you see nothing.
INFO - Reward: False
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since I don't see anything around me, I need to move to a location where I can find a desk, as the desklamp and cd are likely to be on or near a desk.
ACTION: go to desk 1
INFO - Agent Action: go to desk 1
INFO - Observation: You arrive at desk 1. On the desk 1, you see a alarmclock 1, a bowl 1, a desklamp 1, and a mug 1.
INFO - Reward: False
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------

ACTION: examine desklamp 1
INFO - Agent Action: examine desklamp 1
INFO - Observation: You might be too far away to examine the desklamp 1. Try moving closer first, for example using 'go to desklamp 1'.
INFO - Reward: False
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since I'm already at desk 1 where the desklamp 1 is located, I should try to get closer to the desklamp 1 to examine it, but the instruction suggests using 'go to desklamp 1' which seems redundant since I'm at the desk, however, it implies I need to focus on the desklamp 1 specifically.
ACTION: go to desklamp 1
INFO - Agent Action: go to desklamp 1
INFO - Observation: You cannot move directly to objects like 'desklamp 1'. Try using 'go to' with a larger location like a table, counter, or shelf where the object might be.
INFO - Reward: False
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I'm already at desk 1, which is the larger location where the desklamp 1 is, so I should proceed with examining the desklamp 1 directly since moving closer in the context of 'go to' actions isn't applicable here.
ACTION: examine desklamp 1
INFO - Agent Action: examine desklamp 1
INFO - Observation: You might be too far away to examine the desklamp 1. Try moving closer first, for example using 'go to desklamp 1'.
INFO - Reward: False
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since the system still suggests I'm too far to examine the desklamp 1 and I'm already at desk 1, it seems there's a misunderstanding in the movement instructions, but to proceed, I'll try to reassert my location to ensure I'm as close as possible to the desklamp 1 by going to the desk again.
ACTION: go to desk 1
INFO - Agent Action: go to desk 1
INFO - Observation: Could not move to the desk 1. You might already be there or there might be an issue moving there. Try 'look' to confirm your location or try moving elsewhere first.
INFO - Reward: False

INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I need to confirm my location and the objects around me to understand why I couldn't move to desk 1, even though I'm supposedly already there.
ACTION: look
INFO - Agent Action: look
INFO - Observation: You are facing the desk 1. Next to it, you see nothing.
INFO - Reward: False
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since I'm facing desk 1 and I know the desklamp 1 is on it, I should try examining the desklamp 1 again to see if I can find the cd under it.

INFO - Observation: You might be too far away to examine the desklamp 1. Try moving closer first, for example using 'go to desklamp 1'.
INFO - Reward: False
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The system continues to suggest I'm too far to examine the desklamp 1, but since I'm already at desk 1 and can't move directly to the desklamp 1, I'll try a different approach by looking at the desk 1 itself to see if that brings me closer to the desklamp 1 or provides more information.
ACTION: examine desk 1
INFO - Agent Action: examine desk 1
INFO - Observation: On the desk 1, you see a alarmclock 1, a bowl 1, a desklamp 1, and a mug 1.

INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Given the repeated message about being too far away, despite being at desk 1, and the inability to move directly to the desklamp 1, I'll try to look at the objects on the desk 1 again to see if there's any change or additional information.
ACTION: look
INFO - Agent Action: look
INFO - Observation: You are facing the desk 1. Next to it, you see nothing.
INFO - Reward: False
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since I'm facing desk 1 and the desklamp 1 is on it, but I'm still having trouble examining it closely, I should try to interact with the desk 1 in a different way to see if that allows me to get a closer look at the desklamp 1 and the potential cd under it.

INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I have a clear view of the objects on desk 1, and since examining the desklamp 1 directly is not working, I'll try to look under it by examining the space where the cd would likely be, which is under the desklamp 1 on the desk 1.
ACTION: look at the space under the desklamp 1 on desk 1
INFO - Agent Action: look at the space under the desklamp 1 on desk 1
