INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to each receptacle and surface, starting with the countertops, drawers, and cabinets, to search for the peppershakers by using the "examine" action. Then, I will check the fridge, stoveburners, and other appliances to ensure I don't miss any potential locations. Once I find a peppershaker, I will take it and put it in my inventory. I will repeat this process until I find two peppershakers. After finding both peppershakers, I will go to a drawer and use the "move" action to place both peppershakers inside it, thus completing the task.
