INFO - Agent Action: Since the task was to put two soapbar in the garbagecan, but the observations only mentioned soapbottles, it seems there might be a misunderstanding or a missing detail in the task or environment. However, based on the actions taken, it appears that two soapbottles have been placed in the garbagecan. Without further information on how to obtain or create soapbars from soapbottles, or if the task can be considered complete with soapbottles, the next logical step would be to:

INFO - Observation: Nothing happens.
INFO - Reward: False
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Action: Given the task and the current state of the environment, it seems that the goal of putting two soapbar in the garbagecan has not been directly achieved, as the actions taken have involved soapbottles, not soapbars. Without a clear way to obtain or transform soapbottles into soapbars within the provided actions or observations, the task as stated cannot be completed based on the information given.

However, to continue interacting with the environment in a meaningful way, the next action could be to:
