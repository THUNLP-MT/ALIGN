Shea Moisture's Red Palm Oil and Cocoa Butter collection is a completely new experience for shrinkage-prone hair! Our Red Palm Oil and Cocoa Butter Curl Stretch Pudding is a hair styling cream that stretches out curly coily styles with ultimate frizz control. Minimize natural shrinkage and temporarily reveal a longer Afro or curly coily style with this curly hair cream, styling cream and ultra-moisturizing pudding for frizz control. Infused with Red Palm Oil, Cocoa Butter and Flaxseed Oil, this Coconut Oil-free, anti-shrinkage styling cream, forming cream and curly hair cream is the perfect hair cream for women with curly hair. Light hold smoothes cuticles for a frizz-free finish. Our styling cream is like a hair styling gel and forming cream for curly hairstyling. Generously apply curly hair cream to sectioned, detangled hair from roots to ends and style as desired using hair cream. Also use as a hair product or men's styling cream. To refresh your style, smooth a small amount of styling cream between palms and lightly pat curly hair cream on curls. TIP; Pair with hair styling gel for added hold. This hair cream is great for use as a hair styling wax or for frizz control. This Curl Stretch Pudding is formulated with no silicone, no sulfates, no parabens, no phthalates, no mineral oil or petrolatum. It's been tested on our family for generations and never on animals. BRAND STORY; SheaMoisture is the legacy of Sofi Tucker, a pioneering mother of four and an entrepreneur, who sold Shea Butter, African Black Soap and homemade beauty preparations in Sierra Leone in 1912. We honor her vision by continuing to formulate with Raw Shea Butter handcrafted by women in Africa. With every purchase you show support of our mission to reinvest back in our communities.
