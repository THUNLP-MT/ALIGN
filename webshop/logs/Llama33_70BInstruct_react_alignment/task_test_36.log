Discover Garnier Olia Permanent No Ammonia Hair Dye. 60 Percent oil powered hair dye with up to 100 Percent grey coverage. Maximum colour performance, for long-lasting at home hair colour results. On grey hair, colour will appear lighter than on non-grey hair. Choosing your ideal shade: Your hair dye colour result will vary depending on your natural hair colour – check the back of pack. If you are deciding between two shades, always choose the lighter. Remember to always do your patch test 48 hours before colouring your hair at home. Top tips: Use an old towel as hair colour may stain it. Apply moisturising cream to your hairline to avoid staining. Garnier know that oil can do much more than just condition your hair. When concentrated at the heart of the Olia permanent brown hair dye formula, oil maximises the brown hair colour result. Garnier Olia permanent hair dye is a 60 Percent oil-powered formula, with natural flower oils and ammonia free for a pleasant scent. Garnier at home hair dye visibly improves the quality of hair, for better shine and 35 Percent smoother hair**. Olia home hair colour will also provide maximum colour performance for lavish, vivid and long-lasting brown hair. Plus, Olia home hair colour has a distinct sensorial application and optimal scalp comfort with Garnier non-drip smooth velvety texture of the colourant cream. ** Instrumental test vs before and after colouration.How to find the ideal brown shade for you:Have you ever wondered what the hair colour numbers mean? The first number of a Hair Colour is how Light or Dark the brown hair dye will be, for example brown shades range from 4, Dark Brown to 6, Light Brown. The second number is the reflect which can be Natural (.0), Warm (.3, .4, .5, .6) or Cool (.1, .2). For example, 4.0 is a Natural Dark Brown, 4.3 is a Golden Dark Brown and 4.15 is an Ash Dark Brown. Always check the back of pack to see if it is the right shade for you. 1 tube colour crème with a velvety texture and subtle floral fragrance, 1 tube developer cream, 1 applicator bottle, 1 tube of the silk and shine multi-application conditioner, 1 pair of gloves and 1 instruction leaflet

INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The product description mentions it's a permanent hair dye with a 60% oil-powered formula and ammonia-free, but it doesn't explicitly state it's an "old style" brown hair dye, and the packaging includes multiple components, so I'll check the other search results for a more suitable option.
