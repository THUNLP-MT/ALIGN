Pride of India incorporates organically-grown food and herbal products from India into our daily life. These all-natural ingredients help enhance the overall health of the human body. Pride of India is family owned and operated, and we manufacture our products in the USA. Our Himalayan Black Rock Salt is the purest form of salt available on planet Earth because it does not undergo any artificial treatment or refining processes. It is carved out from decades-old, naturally occurring salt reserves at the bed of the giant Himalayan mountains in the Indian subcontinent. The blackish appearance of our salt proves its purity. This coarse salt contains up to 84 essential minerals that are quintessential for the human body in daily nutrition. The grainy texture, distinct flavor, and easy solubility of our black salt make it great for kitchen use as well as in the bath. Black Himalayan salt contains sodium and other electrolytes that can help balance electrolytes, regulate hydration, balance PH levels. Commercial table salt contains between 97.5% and 99.9% sodium chloride, while Himalayan salt only contains about 87%. Additionally, many table salts go through a bleaching process and may even contain harmful ingredients. Our Himalayan salt, however, is natural and doesn’t go through a refining process. Black salt can be used in salt lamps, as a salt substitute, in bath scrubs, or as a bath salt. It’s also a superior substitute for table salt. Use a pinch in your favorite recipe!
