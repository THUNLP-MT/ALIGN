Discover Garnier Olia Permanent No Ammonia Hair Dye. 60 Percent oil powered hair dye with up to 100 Percent grey coverage. Maximum colour performance, for long-lasting at home hair colour results. On grey hair, colour will appear lighter than on non-grey hair. Choosing your ideal shade: Your hair dye colour result will vary depending on your natural hair colour – check the back of pack. If you are deciding between two shades, always choose the lighter. Remember to always do your patch test 48 hours before colouring your hair at home.
