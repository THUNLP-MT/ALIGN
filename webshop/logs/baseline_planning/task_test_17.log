Improve the look of skin with Neutrogena Healthy Skin Sensitive Skin Serum Foundation. Suitable for sensitive skin, this serum-infused foundation doubles as skincare and makeup that provides sheer, natural, and buildable coverage while blurring imperfections, the look of pores, and designed to minimize the look of fine lines. Formulated with Pro-Vitamin B5, a dermatologist-recognized ingredient known to help maintain skin's moisture barrier, the color-correcting, healthy glow liquid foundation goes on smoothly leaving skin soothed while visibly reducing redness. Available in a range of natural-looking shades, the light coverage foundation from a dermatologist-recommended brand is non-comedogenic and fragrance-free, dye-free, paraben-free, phthalate-free, alcohol-free, and sulfate-free. To use foundation to reduce the look of pores, gently shake the bottle, then use clean fingers, sponge, or foundation brush to apply makeup as part of your daily skincare and beauty routine.
