The RPB27 is a portable Bluetooth speaker that is the perfect size and power. This speaker is big enough that our engineers were able to get the speaker to produce 20 watts of power with huge bass! It is small enough to bring it with you camping, hiking, or anywhere else. The speaker is extremely rugged! It is shockproof and IPX6 water resistant. This means you can throw it around and bring it in the shower and the speaker will never break!There may be some similar looking Bluetooth speakers on the market but this is the only speaker at this price point that is rugged, water resistant, and has huge power with huge bass!Below is what makes ours better:IPX6 Water ResistantThe RPB27 is water resistant, or splash proof. You can take it with you into the shower, or by the pool side. In reality this speaker can be thrown into water without getting damaged, but we are rating it as splashproof. I tested it in the shower and put it under the showerhead with no problems.Amazing Power with Bumping Bass!This speaker puts out a huge 20 watts of power. Its louder than any other speaker I have tested that was similar in size. I’ve tested many Bluetooth speakers, and this one sounds better than speakers that are way bigger! Our sound quality is amazing. This speaker has great bass and crystal clear highs with a distortion rating of less than 1%. What makes the bass so loud is that the speaker has a passive radiator to enhance the bass. That basically mean the speaker has an extra subwoofer built in that focuses on playing back bumping bass!Rugged DesignBuilt with 100% ROHS Silicone & ABS, this enclosure design delivers top of the line sound quality. It includes rubber feet for great sound when placing the speaker on any hard surface. The design mold is an exclusive Rockville design!
