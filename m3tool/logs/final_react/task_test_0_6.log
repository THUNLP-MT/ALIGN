INFO - ========== Task Name: message_decoder/length_based_decoding_puzzle | Task ID: 0-6 ==========
INFO - Task: Given three hex-encoded messages, decode each one using the Caesar cipher with a shift of 6. Find the message that has a length equal to 5 after decoding. The hex-encoded messages are ['646566', '6a6b6c6d', '68696a6b6c'].
INFO - Tools Description: You have access to the following tools:
[1] convert_hex_to_ascii: Converts a hexadecimal string to ASCII. Arguments: hex_string (str)
    Signature: convert_hex_to_ascii(hex_string: str) -> str
[2] reverse_string: Reverses a string. Arguments: string (str)
    Signature: reverse_string(string: str) -> str
[3] caesar_decode: Decodes a string using the Caesar cipher. Arguments: message (str), shift (int)
    Signature: caesar_decode(message: str, shift: int) -> str
[4] string_length: Finds the length of a string. Arguments: string (str)
    Signature: string_length(string: str) -> int
[5] minimum_value: Finds the minimum value from given arguments. Arguments: *args (variable number of arguments)
    Signature: minimum_value(*args) -> int/float
[6] maximum_value: Finds the maximum value from given arguments. Arguments: *args (variable number of arguments)
    Signature: maximum_value(*args) -> int/float

INFO - Agent Output: Thought: I need to decode each hex-encoded message using the Caesar cipher with a shift of 6. Then, I will find the message that has a length equal to 5 after decoding. I will start with the first hex-encoded message '646566'.
