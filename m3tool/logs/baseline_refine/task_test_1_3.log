[2] transcribe_dna_to_mrna: Transcribes DNA sequence to mRNA. Arguments: dna_sequence (str)
    Signature: transcribe_dna_to_mrna(dna_sequence: str) -> str
[3] translate_mrna_to_amino_acid: Translates mRNA sequence to a chain of amino acids. Arguments: mrna_sequence (str)
    Signature: translate_mrna_to_amino_acid(mrna_sequence: str) -> str
[4] find_max_nucleotide: Return the nucleotide (str) with the maximum count (int). Arguments: nucleotide_counts in the form of (k1, v1, k2, v2, ..., kn, vn)
    Signature: find_max_nucleotide(*args) -> (str, int)
[5] is_valid_dna_sequence: Checks if the DNA sequence is valid. Arguments: dna_sequence (str)
    Signature: is_valid_dna_sequence(dna_sequence: str) -> bool
[6] reverse_transcribe_mrna_to_dna: Reverse transcribes mRNA sequence to DNA. Arguments: mrna_sequence (str)
    Signature: reverse_transcribe_mrna_to_dna(mrna_sequence: str) -> str

INFO - Agent Action: Action: transcribe_dna_to_mrna, AGCTAGCGTA End Action
INFO - Agent Action: Thought: The DNA sequence has been transcribed to mRNA, but the mRNA sequence needs to be translated to an amino acid sequence and the length of the amino acid sequence needs to be determined.

INFO - Agent Action: Action: transcribe_dna_to_mrna, AGCTAGCGTA End Action
INFO - Agent Action: Thought: The action to transcribe DNA to mRNA was correct, but the instruction also requires translating the mRNA to an amino acid sequence and determining the length of the amino acid sequence. I need to perform the translation and calculate the length.
