INFO - ========== Task Name: message_decoder/longest_decoded_string | Task ID: 0-2 ==========
INFO - Task: Decode a list of messages each going through a series of transformations: first from hex to ASCII, then reversed, and finally a Caesar cipher decode with shifts of 2, 3, and 5 respectively. Find the longest message after decoding. The hex-encoded messages are ['4a656d', '4b6867', '4c696f'].
INFO - Tools Description: You have access to the following tools:
[1] convert_hex_to_ascii: Converts a hexadecimal string to ASCII. Arguments: hex_string (str)
    Signature: convert_hex_to_ascii(hex_string: str) -> str
[2] reverse_string: Reverses a string. Arguments: string (str)
    Signature: reverse_string(string: str) -> str
[3] caesar_decode: Decodes a string using the Caesar cipher. Arguments: message (str), shift (int)
    Signature: caesar_decode(message: str, shift: int) -> str
[4] string_length: Finds the length of a string. Arguments: string (str)
    Signature: string_length(string: str) -> int
[5] minimum_value: Finds the minimum value from given arguments. Arguments: *args (variable number of arguments)
    Signature: minimum_value(*args) -> int/float
[6] maximum_value: Finds the maximum value from given arguments. Arguments: *args (variable number of arguments)
    Signature: maximum_value(*args) -> int/float

Answer: 4
INFO - Agent Action: Thought: The previous actions were to decode each message step by step and find the length of the decoded messages. Now, I need to compare the lengths to find the longest message.
