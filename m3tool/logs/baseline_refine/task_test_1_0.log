INFO - ========== Task Name: cryptobotanists_plant_dna_sequencer/find_most_common_nucleotide_and_transcribe | Task ID: 1-0 ==========
INFO - Task: Find the most common nucleotide in the DNA sequence 'AGCTAGCCGATGCA' and transcribe that nucleotide (repeated three times) to mRNA.
INFO - Tools Description: You have access to the following tools:
[1] count_nucleotides: Counts the occurrences of each nucleotide in a DNA sequence. Arguments: dna_sequence (str)
    Signature: count_nucleotides(dna_sequence: str) -> dict
[2] transcribe_dna_to_mrna: Transcribes DNA sequence to mRNA. Arguments: dna_sequence (str)
    Signature: transcribe_dna_to_mrna(dna_sequence: str) -> str
[3] translate_mrna_to_amino_acid: Translates mRNA sequence to a chain of amino acids. Arguments: mrna_sequence (str)
    Signature: translate_mrna_to_amino_acid(mrna_sequence: str) -> str
[4] find_max_nucleotide: Return the nucleotide (str) with the maximum count (int). Arguments: nucleotide_counts in the form of (k1, v1, k2, v2, ..., kn, vn)
    Signature: find_max_nucleotide(*args) -> (str, int)
[5] is_valid_dna_sequence: Checks if the DNA sequence is valid. Arguments: dna_sequence (str)
    Signature: is_valid_dna_sequence(dna_sequence: str) -> bool
[6] reverse_transcribe_mrna_to_dna: Reverse transcribes mRNA sequence to DNA. Arguments: mrna_sequence (str)
    Signature: reverse_transcribe_mrna_to_dna(mrna_sequence: str) -> str

INFO - Agent Action: Action: count_nucleotides, AGCTAGCCGATGCA End Action
INFO - Agent Action: Thought: I need to count the nucleotides in the given DNA sequence first, then find the most common nucleotide, and finally transcribe that nucleotide three times to mRNA.
Final Action: count_nucleotides, AGCTAGCCGATGCA End Action
INFO - Agent Action: Action: count_nucleotides, AGCTAGCCGATGCA End Action
INFO - Observation: {'A': 4, 'G': 4, 'C': 4, 'T': 2}
INFO - Reward: 0.0
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Action: Action: find_max_nucleotide, A, 4, G, 4, C, 4, T, 2 End Action
INFO - Agent Action: Thought: The most common nucleotide is either A, G, or C with a count of 4. I need to choose one of them and transcribe it three times.
Final Action: Action: transcribe_dna_to_mrna, AAA End Action
INFO - Agent Action: Action: Action: transcribe_dna_to_mrna, AAA End Action
INFO - Observation: Cound not find tool with name 
*Extra reminder: You have output more than one action. Only the first action will be used.
INFO - Reward: 0.0
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Action: Action: transcribe_dna_to_mrna, AAA End Action
INFO - Agent Action: Thought: The previous action was correct, but the tool name was misspelled.
Final Action: transcribe_dna_to_mrna, AAA End Action
INFO - Agent Action: Action: transcribe_dna_to_mrna, AAA End Action
INFO - Observation: UUU
INFO - Reward: 0.0
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Action: Answer: UUU
INFO - Agent Action: Thought: The previous action was to transcribe 'AAA' to mRNA, which resulted in 'UUU'. This is correct based on the transcription rules (A -> U).
Final Answer: UUU
INFO - Agent Action: Answer: UUU
INFO - Observation: Correct!
INFO - Reward: 1.0
INFO - Done: True
