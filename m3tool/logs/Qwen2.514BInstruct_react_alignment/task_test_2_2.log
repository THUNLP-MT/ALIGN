INFO - ========== Task Name: trade_calculator/taxed_commodity_export | Task ID: 2-2 ==========
INFO - Task: An intergalactic trader is exporting 200 units of a rare mineral. The base price per unit is 120 galactic credits. The conversion rate today is 2.0 for converting galactic credits to the universal trade currency (UTC). The tariff rate for exporting this mineral is 5%. Calculate the total cost including tariff in UTC.
INFO - Tools Description: You have access to the following tools:
[1] convert_currency: Converts the commodity price to local currency. Arguments: base_price (float), conversion_rate (float)
    Signature: convert_currency(base_price: float, conversion_rate: float) -> float
[2] calculate_tariff: Calculates the trade tariff based on the converted price. Arguments: price (float), tariff_rate (float, in %)
    Signature: calculate_tariff(price: float, tariff_rate: float) -> float
[3] estimate_final_value: Estimates the final trade value including the tariff. Arguments: price (float), tariff (float)
    Signature: estimate_final_value(price: float, tariff: float) -> float
[4] calculator: Evaluates the given expression and returns the result. Accepts a calculation expression as input. For example, "2 + (3 * 4)" will return 14.
    Signature: calculator(expression: str) -> float
[5] find_minimum: Finds the minimum value among the given arguments. Accepts variable number of float arguments.
    Signature: find_minimum(*args: float) -> float
[6] find_maximum: Finds the maximum value among the given arguments. Accepts variable number of float arguments.
    Signature: find_maximum(*args: float) -> float

INFO - Agent Output: Thought: First, I need to convert the base price per unit from galactic credits to universal trade currency (UTC) using the conversion rate.
