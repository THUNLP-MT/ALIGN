INFO - ========== Task Name: cryptobotanists_plant_dna_sequencer/transcribe_translate_amino_acid_length | Task ID: 1-3 ==========
INFO - Task: Transcribe the DNA sequence 'AGCTAGCGTA' to mRNA, translate it to an amino acid sequence, and determine the length of the amino acid sequence.
INFO - Tools Description: You have access to the following tools:
[1] count_nucleotides: Counts the occurrences of each nucleotide in a DNA sequence. Arguments: dna_sequence (str)
    Signature: count_nucleotides(dna_sequence: str) -> dict
[2] transcribe_dna_to_mrna: Transcribes DNA sequence to mRNA. Arguments: dna_sequence (str)
    Signature: transcribe_dna_to_mrna(dna_sequence: str) -> str
[3] translate_mrna_to_amino_acid: Translates mRNA sequence to a chain of amino acids. Arguments: mrna_sequence (str)
    Signature: translate_mrna_to_amino_acid(mrna_sequence: str) -> str
[4] find_max_nucleotide: Return the nucleotide (str) with the maximum count (int). Arguments: nucleotide_counts in the form of (k1, v1, k2, v2, ..., kn, vn)
    Signature: find_max_nucleotide(*args) -> (str, int)
[5] is_valid_dna_sequence: Checks if the DNA sequence is valid. Arguments: dna_sequence (str)
    Signature: is_valid_dna_sequence(dna_sequence: str) -> bool
[6] reverse_transcribe_mrna_to_dna: Reverse transcribes mRNA sequence to DNA. Arguments: mrna_sequence (str)
    Signature: reverse_transcribe_mrna_to_dna(mrna_sequence: str) -> str

INFO - Agent Output: Thought: To solve this problem, we need to first transcribe the DNA sequence to mRNA, then translate the mRNA sequence to an amino acid sequence, and finally determine the length of the amino acid sequence.

INFO - Observation: UCGAUCGCAU
INFO - Reward: 0.0
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: Thought: Now that we have the mRNA sequence, we can translate it to an amino acid sequence.

Action: translate_mrna_to_amino_acid, UCGAUCGCAU End Action
INFO - Agent Action: Action: translate_mrna_to_amino_acid, UCGAUCGCAU End Action
INFO - Observation: X-X-X-X
INFO - Reward: 0.0
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: Thought: The translation of the mRNA sequence 'UCGAUCGCAU' to an amino acid sequence resulted in 'X-X-X-X', which is not a valid amino acid sequence. This indicates that the mRNA sequence is not valid or the translation was incorrect.

Action: is_valid_dna_sequence, AGCTAGCGTA End Action
INFO - Agent Action: Action: is_valid_dna_sequence, AGCTAGCGTA End Action
INFO - Observation: True
INFO - Reward: 0.0
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: Thought: Since the DNA sequence 'AGCTAGCGTA' is valid, we can now check if the mRNA sequence 'UCGAUCGCAU' is valid.

Action: is_valid_dna_sequence, UCGAUCGCAU End Action
INFO - Agent Action: Action: is_valid_dna_sequence, UCGAUCGCAU End Action
INFO - Observation: False
INFO - Reward: 0.0
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: Thought: Since the mRNA sequence 'UCGAUCGCAU' is not valid, we cannot translate it to an amino acid sequence. However, we can still determine the length of the amino acid sequence that would have been obtained if the mRNA sequence was valid.

INFO - Observation: X-X-X-X
INFO - Reward: 0.0
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: Thought: The length of the amino acid sequence 'X-X-X-X' is 4.
