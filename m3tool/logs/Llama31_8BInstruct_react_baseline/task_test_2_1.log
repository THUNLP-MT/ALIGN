INFO - ========== Task Name: trade_calculator/interstellar_trade_transaction | Task ID: 2-1 ==========
INFO - Task: Calculate the final trade value for an intergalactic trader who is exchanging 100 units of space ore. The base price per unit is 50 galactic credits, the conversion rate to local currency is 1.5, and the trade tariff rate is 8%. Provide the final trade value in local currency.
INFO - Tools Description: You have access to the following tools:
[1] convert_currency: Converts the commodity price to local currency. Arguments: base_price (float), conversion_rate (float)
    Signature: convert_currency(base_price: float, conversion_rate: float) -> float
[2] calculate_tariff: Calculates the trade tariff based on the converted price. Arguments: price (float), tariff_rate (float, in %)
    Signature: calculate_tariff(price: float, tariff_rate: float) -> float
[3] estimate_final_value: Estimates the final trade value including the tariff. Arguments: price (float), tariff (float)
    Signature: estimate_final_value(price: float, tariff: float) -> float
[4] calculator: Evaluates the given expression and returns the result. Accepts a calculation expression as input. For example, "2 + (3 * 4)" will return 14.
    Signature: calculator(expression: str) -> float
[5] find_minimum: Finds the minimum value among the given arguments. Accepts variable number of float arguments.
    Signature: find_minimum(*args: float) -> float
[6] find_maximum: Finds the maximum value among the given arguments. Accepts variable number of float arguments.
    Signature: find_maximum(*args: float) -> float

INFO - Agent Output: Thought: To calculate the final trade value, we need to first convert the base price to local currency, then calculate the trade tariff, and finally estimate the final trade value.

Action: convert_currency, 50, 1.5 End Action
Thought: Now we have the price in local currency, we can proceed to calculate the trade tariff.
