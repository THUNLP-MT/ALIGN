INFO - ========== Task Name: trade_calculator/long_term_vs_short_term_trade_decisions | Task ID: 2-16 ==========
INFO - Task: Evaluate long-term versus short-term trade decisions. A trader can sell a commodity either now or wait a month for potentially better prices. Current scenario: sell 600 units at 200 credits per unit, conversion rate 1.8, tariff 5%. Potential future scenario: sell the same quantity at a 10% higher price, but face a 2% increase in tariff and a 0.2 decrease in conversion rate. Calculate and compare the final trade values for both scenarios. Provide your answer as a list of two values in order of [current, future scenario], separated by commas. Example: 'Answer: [1000, 2000]'
INFO - Tools Description: You have access to the following tools:
[1] convert_currency: Converts the commodity price to local currency. Arguments: base_price (float), conversion_rate (float)
    Signature: convert_currency(base_price: float, conversion_rate: float) -> float
[2] calculate_tariff: Calculates the trade tariff based on the converted price. Arguments: price (float), tariff_rate (float, in %)
    Signature: calculate_tariff(price: float, tariff_rate: float) -> float
[3] estimate_final_value: Estimates the final trade value including the tariff. Arguments: price (float), tariff (float)
    Signature: estimate_final_value(price: float, tariff: float) -> float
[4] calculator: Evaluates the given expression and returns the result. Accepts a calculation expression as input. For example, "2 + (3 * 4)" will return 14.
    Signature: calculator(expression: str) -> float
[5] find_minimum: Finds the minimum value among the given arguments. Accepts variable number of float arguments.
    Signature: find_minimum(*args: float) -> float
[6] find_maximum: Finds the maximum value among the given arguments. Accepts variable number of float arguments.
    Signature: find_maximum(*args: float) -> float

INFO - Agent Output: Thought: To compare the final trade values for both scenarios, we need to calculate the current and future trade values, including the tariff and conversion rate.
