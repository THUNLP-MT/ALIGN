INFO - ========== Task Name: trade_calculator/dynamic_pricing_strategy | Task ID: 2-11 ==========
INFO - Task: A trader is considering a dynamic pricing strategy for a commodity with a base price of 300 credits per unit. The strategy involves adjusting the price based on market demand: increase by 10% in high demand and decrease by 5% in low demand. Analyze three scenarios - high demand (120 units), normal demand (100 units), and low demand (80 units) with a constant conversion rate of 1.8 and a tariff rate of 6%. Calculate the final trade value for each scenario. Provide your answer as a list of three values, separated by commas.Example: 'Answer: [1000, 2000, 3000]'
INFO - Tools Description: You have access to the following tools:
[1] convert_currency: Converts the commodity price to local currency. Arguments: base_price (float), conversion_rate (float)
    Signature: convert_currency(base_price: float, conversion_rate: float) -> float
[2] calculate_tariff: Calculates the trade tariff based on the converted price. Arguments: price (float), tariff_rate (float, in %)
    Signature: calculate_tariff(price: float, tariff_rate: float) -> float
[3] estimate_final_value: Estimates the final trade value including the tariff. Arguments: price (float), tariff (float)
    Signature: estimate_final_value(price: float, tariff: float) -> float
[4] calculator: Evaluates the given expression and returns the result. Accepts a calculation expression as input. For example, "2 + (3 * 4)" will return 14.
    Signature: calculator(expression: str) -> float
[5] find_minimum: Finds the minimum value among the given arguments. Accepts variable number of float arguments.
    Signature: find_minimum(*args: float) -> float
[6] find_maximum: Finds the maximum value among the given arguments. Accepts variable number of float arguments.
    Signature: find_maximum(*args: float) -> float

INFO - Agent Output: Thought: To calculate the final trade value for each scenario, we need to first convert the base price to the local currency, then adjust the price based on market demand, calculate the trade tariff, and finally estimate the final trade value.
