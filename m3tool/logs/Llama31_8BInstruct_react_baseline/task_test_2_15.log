INFO - ========== Task Name: trade_calculator/variable_tariff_profit_maximization | Task ID: 2-15 ==========
INFO - Task: A trader is exploring profit maximization strategies with variable tariff rates. The commodity price is 300 credits per unit. Compare three selling strategies: 400 units with a 6% tariff, 350 units with a 4% tariff, and 450 units with a 7% tariff. The conversion rate is fixed at 1.7. Determine the maximum final trade value among the three options.
INFO - Tools Description: You have access to the following tools:
[1] convert_currency: Converts the commodity price to local currency. Arguments: base_price (float), conversion_rate (float)
    Signature: convert_currency(base_price: float, conversion_rate: float) -> float
[2] calculate_tariff: Calculates the trade tariff based on the converted price. Arguments: price (float), tariff_rate (float, in %)
    Signature: calculate_tariff(price: float, tariff_rate: float) -> float
[3] estimate_final_value: Estimates the final trade value including the tariff. Arguments: price (float), tariff (float)
    Signature: estimate_final_value(price: float, tariff: float) -> float
[4] calculator: Evaluates the given expression and returns the result. Accepts a calculation expression as input. For example, "2 + (3 * 4)" will return 14.
    Signature: calculator(expression: str) -> float
[5] find_minimum: Finds the minimum value among the given arguments. Accepts variable number of float arguments.
    Signature: find_minimum(*args: float) -> float
[6] find_maximum: Finds the maximum value among the given arguments. Accepts variable number of float arguments.
    Signature: find_maximum(*args: float) -> float

INFO - Agent Output: Thought: To find the maximum final trade value, we need to calculate the final trade value for each option and then compare them.
