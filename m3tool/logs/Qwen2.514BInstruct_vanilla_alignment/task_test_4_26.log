INFO - Agent Action: To solve this, I need to know the prices of the items "Ancient Wand" and "Enchanted Potion". However, the instruction does not provide these details. Assuming we have a way to find these prices, here's how I would proceed:

1. Find the prices of "Ancient Wand" and "Enchanted Potion".
2. Calculate the total price of these items.
3. Apply a 10% discount on the total price.
4. Format the final price as 'xx.xx'.

Since I don't have the prices, I'll assume hypothetical prices for demonstration purposes. Let's say the price of "Ancient Wand" is 50 and the price of "Enchanted Potion" is 30.
