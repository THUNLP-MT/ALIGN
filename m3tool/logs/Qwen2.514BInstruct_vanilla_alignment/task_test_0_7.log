INFO - ========== Task Name: message_decoder/maximum_value_decoding | Task ID: 0-7 ==========
INFO - Task: Decode a list of hex-encoded messages using a Caesar cipher with a shift of 4, reverse them, and find the numerical maximum value of these decoded strings. Assume the decoded strings represent integers. The hex-encoded messages are ['313233', '343536', '373839'].
INFO - Tools Description: You have access to the following tools:
[1] convert_hex_to_ascii: Converts a hexadecimal string to ASCII. Arguments: hex_string (str)
    Signature: convert_hex_to_ascii(hex_string: str) -> str
[2] reverse_string: Reverses a string. Arguments: string (str)
    Signature: reverse_string(string: str) -> str
[3] caesar_decode: Decodes a string using the Caesar cipher. Arguments: message (str), shift (int)
    Signature: caesar_decode(message: str, shift: int) -> str
[4] string_length: Finds the length of a string. Arguments: string (str)
    Signature: string_length(string: str) -> int
[5] minimum_value: Finds the minimum value from given arguments. Arguments: *args (variable number of arguments)
    Signature: minimum_value(*args) -> int/float
[6] maximum_value: Finds the maximum value from given arguments. Arguments: *args (variable number of arguments)
    Signature: maximum_value(*args) -> int/float

INFO - Agent Action: Action: convert_hex_to_ascii, '313233' End Action
INFO - Observation: Failed to execute tool convert_hex_to_ascii with args ("'313233'",). Did you try to invoke more than one tool at a time?

Action: convert_hex_to_ascii, '343536' End Action
Action: convert_hex_to_ascii, '373839' End Action

Since I can only call one tool at a time, I will decode each hex string to ASCII one by one, then proceed to decode using the Caesar cipher, reverse the strings, and finally find the maximum value. Let's start with the first hex string '313233'.
