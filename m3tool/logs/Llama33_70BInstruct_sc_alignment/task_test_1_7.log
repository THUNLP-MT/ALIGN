INFO - ========== Task Name: cryptobotanists_plant_dna_sequencer/find_most_common_nucleotide_combined_sequence | Task ID: 1-7 ==========
INFO - Task: Combine the DNA sequences ['AGCT', 'CCGA', 'TTAG'] and find the most common nucleotide in the combined sequence.
INFO - Tools Description: You have access to the following tools:
[1] count_nucleotides: Counts the occurrences of each nucleotide in a DNA sequence. Arguments: dna_sequence (str)
    Signature: count_nucleotides(dna_sequence: str) -> dict
[2] transcribe_dna_to_mrna: Transcribes DNA sequence to mRNA. Arguments: dna_sequence (str)
    Signature: transcribe_dna_to_mrna(dna_sequence: str) -> str
[3] translate_mrna_to_amino_acid: Translates mRNA sequence to a chain of amino acids. Arguments: mrna_sequence (str)
    Signature: translate_mrna_to_amino_acid(mrna_sequence: str) -> str
[4] find_max_nucleotide: Return the nucleotide (str) with the maximum count (int). Arguments: nucleotide_counts in the form of (k1, v1, k2, v2, ..., kn, vn)
    Signature: find_max_nucleotide(*args) -> (str, int)
[5] is_valid_dna_sequence: Checks if the DNA sequence is valid. Arguments: dna_sequence (str)
    Signature: is_valid_dna_sequence(dna_sequence: str) -> bool
[6] reverse_transcribe_mrna_to_dna: Reverse transcribes mRNA sequence to DNA. Arguments: mrna_sequence (str)
    Signature: reverse_transcribe_mrna_to_dna(mrna_sequence: str) -> str

INFO - Agent Action: To find the most common nucleotide in the combined DNA sequence, we first need to combine the sequences and then count the occurrences of each nucleotide. The combined sequence is 'AGCTCCGATTAG'. 

Action: count_nucleotides, AGCTCCGATTAG End Action
INFO - Observation: {'A': 3, 'G': 3, 'C': 3, 'T': 3}
INFO - Reward: 0.0
INFO - Done: False
INFO - Log contents when executing `WrapStep`: INFO - Original agent action: 'To find the most common nucleotide in the combined DNA sequence, we first need to combine the sequences and then count the occurrences of each nucleotide. The combined sequence is 'AGCTCCGATTAG'. 

Action: count_nucleotides, AGCTCCGATTAG End Action'
INFO - Reconstructed agent action for env.step: 'Action: count_nucleotides, AGCTCCGATTAG End Action'


INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Action: Now that we have the nucleotide counts, we can find the most common nucleotide by comparing these counts.

Action: find_max_nucleotide, A, 3, G, 3, C, 3, T, 3 End Action
INFO - Observation: ('A', 3)
INFO - Reward: 0.0

INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Action: Since there are multiple nucleotides with the same maximum count, we can consider any of them as the most common. 

Answer: ('A', 3)
INFO - Observation: Error: Invalid format. Please use 'Action: tool_name, argument_1 End Action' for tool calls with arguments, 'Action: tool_name End Action' for tool calls without arguments, or 'Answer: <your answer>' to provide the final answer.
INFO - Reward: 0.0
INFO - Done: False
INFO - Log contents when executing `WrapStep`: WARNING - Action string 'Since there are multiple nucleotides with the same maximum count, we can consider any of them as the most common. 

Answer: ('A', 3)' does not contain a valid 'Action: ... End Action' block or start with 'Answer:'.


INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Action: Answer: A
INFO - Observation: Incorrect! The expected output is: ('A', 3)
INFO - Reward: 0
INFO - Done: True
