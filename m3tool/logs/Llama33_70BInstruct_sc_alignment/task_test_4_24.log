INFO - Agent Action: To find the total price of the items after applying a 10% discount, I first need to know the prices of the Legendary Wand, Enchanted Potion, and Magical Spellbook. Since the prices are not provided, let's assume hypothetical prices for demonstration: Legendary Wand ($100), Enchanted Potion ($50), and Magical Spellbook ($200).

1. Calculate the total price before the discount: $100 (Wand) + $50 (Potion) + $200 (Spellbook) = $350.
2. Apply a 10% discount on the total price: 10% of $350 = 0.10 * $350 = $35.
3. Subtract the discount from the total price to get the final price: $350 - $35 = $315.

However, since the actual prices of the items are not given, and I cannot perform calculations without specific numbers or use the calculator tool with variables, I will demonstrate how to use the calculator tool with hypothetical total price calculation and discount application.

Action: calculator, "350 - (0.1 * 350)" End Action
