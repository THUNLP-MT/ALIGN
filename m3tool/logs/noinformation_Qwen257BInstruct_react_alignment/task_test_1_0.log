INFO - Agent Output: Thought: I need to count the occurrences of each nucleotide in the DNA sequence first, then find the most common nucleotide, and finally transcribe that nucleotide (repeated three times) to mRNA.
Action: count_nucleotides, AGCTAGCCGATGCA End Action
INFO - Agent Action: Action: count_nucleotides, AGCTAGCCGATGCA End Action

INFO - Reward: 0.0
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: Thought: I have the nucleotide counts. Now I need to find the most common nucleotide.

INFO - Agent Action: Action: find_max_nucleotide, A 4 G 4 C 4 T 2 End Action
INFO - Observation: Failed to execute tool find_max_nucleotide with args ('A 4 G 4 C 4 T 2',). Did you try to invoke more than one tool at a time?
INFO - Reward: 0.0
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: Thought: I need to correct my approach. I should use the tool to find the maximum nucleotide count and then use that nucleotide to transcribe to mRNA.

INFO - Reward: 0.0
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: Thought: I need to use the find_max_nucleotide tool to determine the most common nucleotide.

INFO - Reward: 0.0
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: Thought: It seems there was an error in the tool invocation format. I will invoke the tool correctly to find the most common nucleotide.

INFO - Reward: 0.0
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: Thought: There seems to be a persistent issue with the tool invocation. I will proceed by identifying the most common nucleotide manually from the counts provided.
Answer: The most common nucleotide is 'A', 'G', or 'C' as they all have the highest count of 4. For the purpose of this task, let's use 'A' as the most common nucleotide.
Thought: Now I need to transcribe the most common nucleotide (A) repeated three times to mRNA.
Action: transcribe_dna_to_mrna, AAA End Action
INFO - Agent Action: Action: transcribe_dna_to_mrna, AAA End Action
INFO - Observation: UUU
INFO - Reward: 0.0
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: Thought: The mRNA sequence for 'AAA' is 'UUU'. Now I need to provide the final answer.
Answer: UUU
INFO - Agent Action: Answer: UUU
INFO - Observation: Error: The final answer format is incorrect. Based on the instruction, the answer should be a Python dictionary string (e.g., {'T': 1, 'A': 2}). Your output could not be parsed as a dictionary. Your output was: 'UUU'
INFO - Reward: 0.0
INFO - Done: False
INFO - Log contents when executing `WrapStep`: WARNING - Answer format is incorrect. Expected dictionary, but failed to parse as Python literal. Content: 'UUU'. Error: malformed node or string on line 1: <ast.Name object at 0x7f69eb5f2500>


INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: Thought: The final answer should be in the form of a Python dictionary string. Since the transcribed mRNA sequence is 'UUU', I will format it as a dictionary with the nucleotide 'U' and its count 3.
Answer: {'U': 3}
INFO - Agent Action: Answer: {'U': 3}
INFO - Observation: Incorrect! The expected output is: UUU
INFO - Reward: 0
INFO - Done: True
