INFO - ========== Task Name: trade_calculator/optimizing_bulk_purchase_discounts | Task ID: 2-13 ==========
INFO - Task: A trader can benefit from bulk purchase discounts: 5% off for orders of 1000 units or more. Evaluate two commodities: Commodity A (base price 150 credits per unit) and Commodity B (base price 180 credits per unit). Assess the final trade value for purchasing 950 units and 1050 units of each commodity, with a conversion rate of 1.6 and a tariff rate of 7%.Determine the maximum final trade value among the four options.
INFO - Tools Description: You have access to the following tools:
[1] convert_currency: Converts the commodity price to local currency. Arguments: base_price (float), conversion_rate (float)
    Signature: convert_currency(base_price: float, conversion_rate: float) -> float
[2] calculate_tariff: Calculates the trade tariff based on the converted price. Arguments: price (float), tariff_rate (float, in %)
    Signature: calculate_tariff(price: float, tariff_rate: float) -> float
[3] estimate_final_value: Estimates the final trade value including the tariff. Arguments: price (float), tariff (float)
    Signature: estimate_final_value(price: float, tariff: float) -> float
[4] calculator: Evaluates the given expression and returns the result. Accepts a calculation expression as input. For example, "2 + (3 * 4)" will return 14.
    Signature: calculator(expression: str) -> float
[5] find_minimum: Finds the minimum value among the given arguments. Accepts variable number of float arguments.
    Signature: find_minimum(*args: float) -> float
[6] find_maximum: Finds the maximum value among the given arguments. Accepts variable number of float arguments.
    Signature: find_maximum(*args: float) -> float

INFO - Agent Output: Thought: I need to calculate the final trade value for each commodity at both 950 and 1050 units, considering the bulk purchase discount, conversion rate, and tariff rate. Then, I will find the maximum final trade value among the four options.
