INFO - ========== Task Name: cryptobotanists_plant_dna_sequencer/reverse_transcribe_count_max_nucleotide | Task ID: 1-2 ==========
INFO - Task: For the mRNA sequence 'AUGCUUUUC', reverse transcribe it to DNA, count the nucleotides, and find the maximum occurring nucleotide. Answer the maximum occurring nucleotide, not the count.
INFO - Tools Description: You have access to the following tools:
[1] count_nucleotides: Counts the occurrences of each nucleotide in a DNA sequence. Arguments: dna_sequence (str)
    Signature: count_nucleotides(dna_sequence: str) -> dict
[2] transcribe_dna_to_mrna: Transcribes DNA sequence to mRNA. Arguments: dna_sequence (str)
    Signature: transcribe_dna_to_mrna(dna_sequence: str) -> str
[3] translate_mrna_to_amino_acid: Translates mRNA sequence to a chain of amino acids. Arguments: mrna_sequence (str)
    Signature: translate_mrna_to_amino_acid(mrna_sequence: str) -> str
[4] find_max_nucleotide: Return the nucleotide (str) with the maximum count (int). Arguments: nucleotide_counts in the form of (k1, v1, k2, v2, ..., kn, vn)
    Signature: find_max_nucleotide(*args) -> (str, int)
[5] is_valid_dna_sequence: Checks if the DNA sequence is valid. Arguments: dna_sequence (str)
    Signature: is_valid_dna_sequence(dna_sequence: str) -> bool
[6] reverse_transcribe_mrna_to_dna: Reverse transcribes mRNA sequence to DNA. Arguments: mrna_sequence (str)
    Signature: reverse_transcribe_mrna_to_dna(mrna_sequence: str) -> str

INFO - Agent Output: Thought: I need to reverse transcribe the mRNA sequence to DNA, count the nucleotides, and then find the maximum occurring nucleotide. I will start by reverse transcribing the mRNA sequence to DNA.
Action: reverse_transcribe_mrna_to_dna,AUGCUUUUC End Action
INFO - Agent Action: Action: reverse_transcribe_mrna_to_dna,AUGCUUUUC End Action
INFO - Observation: TACGAAAAG
INFO - Reward: 0.0
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: Thought: Now that I have the DNA sequence, I will count the nucleotides in it.
Action: count_nucleotides,TACGAAAAG End Action
INFO - Agent Action: Action: count_nucleotides,TACGAAAAG End Action
INFO - Observation: {'T': 1, 'A': 5, 'C': 1, 'G': 2}
INFO - Reward: 0.0
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: Thought: Now that I have the nucleotide counts, I will find the maximum occurring nucleotide.
Action: find_max_nucleotide,T 1 A 5 C 1 G 2 End Action
INFO - Agent Action: Action: find_max_nucleotide,T 1 A 5 C 1 G 2 End Action
INFO - Observation: Failed to execute tool find_max_nucleotide with args ('T 1 A 5 C 1 G 2',). Did you try to invoke more than one tool at a time?
INFO - Reward: 0.0
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: Thought: It seems there was an error because I passed the arguments in a wrong format. I need to pass the arguments as separate positional arguments.
Action: find_max_nucleotide,T,1,A,5,C,1,G,2 End Action
INFO - Agent Action: Action: find_max_nucleotide,T,1,A,5,C,1,G,2 End Action
INFO - Observation: ('A', 5)
INFO - Reward: 0.0
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: Thought: The tool has returned the maximum occurring nucleotide and its count. The nucleotide 'A' occurs the most with a count of 5.
Answer: A
INFO - Agent Action: Answer: A
INFO - Observation: Error: The final answer format is incorrect. Based on the instruction, the answer should be a Python dictionary string (e.g., {'T': 1, 'A': 2}). Your output could not be parsed as a dictionary. Your output was: 'A'
INFO - Reward: 0.0
INFO - Done: False
INFO - Log contents when executing `WrapStep`: WARNING - Answer format is incorrect. Expected dictionary, but failed to parse as Python literal. Content: 'A'. Error: malformed node or string on line 1: <ast.Name object at 0x7f69eb5ed8d0>


INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: Thought: The tool has returned the maximum occurring nucleotide and its count as a tuple. I need to format the answer as a Python dictionary string.
Answer: {'A': 5}
INFO - Agent Action: Answer: {'A': 5}
INFO - Observation: Incorrect! The expected output is: A
INFO - Reward: 0
INFO - Done: True
