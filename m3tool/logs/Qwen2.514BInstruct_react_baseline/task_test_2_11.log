INFO - ========== Task Name: trade_calculator/dynamic_pricing_strategy | Task ID: 2-11 ==========
INFO - Task: A trader is considering a dynamic pricing strategy for a commodity with a base price of 300 credits per unit. The strategy involves adjusting the price based on market demand: increase by 10% in high demand and decrease by 5% in low demand. Analyze three scenarios - high demand (120 units), normal demand (100 units), and low demand (80 units) with a constant conversion rate of 1.8 and a tariff rate of 6%. Calculate the final trade value for each scenario. Provide your answer as a list of three values, separated by commas.Example: 'Answer: [1000, 2000, 3000]'
INFO - Tools Description: You have access to the following tools:
[1] convert_currency: Converts the commodity price to local currency. Arguments: base_price (float), conversion_rate (float)
    Signature: convert_currency(base_price: float, conversion_rate: float) -> float
[2] calculate_tariff: Calculates the trade tariff based on the converted price. Arguments: price (float), tariff_rate (float, in %)
    Signature: calculate_tariff(price: float, tariff_rate: float) -> float
[3] estimate_final_value: Estimates the final trade value including the tariff. Arguments: price (float), tariff (float)
    Signature: estimate_final_value(price: float, tariff: float) -> float
[4] calculator: Evaluates the given expression and returns the result. Accepts a calculation expression as input. For example, "2 + (3 * 4)" will return 14.
    Signature: calculator(expression: str) -> float
[5] find_minimum: Finds the minimum value among the given arguments. Accepts variable number of float arguments.
    Signature: find_minimum(*args: float) -> float
[6] find_maximum: Finds the maximum value among the given arguments. Accepts variable number of float arguments.
    Signature: find_maximum(*args: float) -> float

INFO - Agent Output: Thought: First, I need to calculate the adjusted prices for high, normal, and low demand scenarios. The base price is 300 credits per unit. In high demand, the price increases by 10%, in normal demand, the price remains the same, and in low demand, the price decreases by 5%. I will calculate the adjusted prices for each scenario.

INFO - Agent Output: Thought: The adjusted price for low demand is 285 credits per unit. Now, I have the adjusted prices for high demand (330 credits), normal demand (300 credits), and low demand (285 credits). Next, I need to convert these prices to the local currency using the conversion rate of 1.8.
