To find out if 'Methionine' is in the amino acid sequence, we need to know the amino acid sequence first. However, the tool 'translate_mrna_to_amino_acid' does not return the amino acid sequence, it only translates the mRNA sequence to a chain of amino acids. Therefore, we cannot directly use the tool 'is_methionine_in_amino_acid_sequence'. We need to find another way to solve this problem.

Since we have the mRNA sequence, we can use the tool 'translate_mrna_to_amino_acid' to get the amino acid sequence. Then we can check if 'Methionine' is in the amino acid sequence.
