INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: Thought: I have found hotels in "D" with wifi. Since I prefer a hotel with a high rating, I choose the one with a rating of 5, which costs $135 per night. For a 3-night stay, the total hotel cost in "D" will be $135 * 3 = $405. Now, I have all the costs: flight from "E" to "A" ($450), hotel in "A" ($200), flight from "A" to "B" ($460), hotel in "B" ($300), flight from "B" to "D" ($490), and hotel in "D" ($405). I can calculate the total budget for the trip.
