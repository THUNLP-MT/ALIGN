INFO - Reward: 0.0
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: Thought: It seems that the "view" tool is not available. Let me try to use a different tool to see the current content of the webpage. Since I don't have any specific URL to click, I can try to scroll down to see if there's any relevant information.

INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: Thought: Since the URL is not found, I should try a different approach. I can try to use the available tools to navigate or search for information about Henry Santiago. However, without a specific URL or a visible link, I'm limited in my options. Let me try to think of a different tool that might be helpful.

Action: click_url,[Clickable 'https://www.google.com/search?q=Henry+Santiago+expertise']] End Action
INFO - Agent Action: Action: click_url,[Clickable 'https://www.google.com/search?q=Henry+Santiago+expertise']] End Action

INFO - Reward: 0.0
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: Thought: It seems that I'm unable to find a valid URL to click. In this case, I should try to use a different tool that doesn't require a URL. Since I'm trying to find the expertise of Henry Santiago, I should look for a tool that allows me to view or search for information.

Action: click_url,[Clickable 'Henry Santiago']] End Action
INFO - Agent Action: Action: click_url,[Clickable 'Henry Santiago']] End Action
INFO - Observation: [URL not found.]
INFO - Reward: 0.0
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: Thought: Since I'm unable to find a valid URL to click, I should try to think of a different approach. I can try to use the "calculator" tool to see if it can help me in any way, but it's unlikely to be useful for finding Henry Santiago's expertise. Another option is to try to go back to a previous page or scroll up/down, but these tools are also not available. At this point, I'm out of options and should admit that I don't have enough information to find Henry Santiago's expertise.
