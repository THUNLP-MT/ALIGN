INFO - ========== Task Name: trade_calculator/optimal_trade_route_multiple_commodities | Task ID: 2-8 ==========
INFO - Task: A trader needs to select the most profitable trade route for three different commodities. Commodity 1: 150 units at 200 credits per unit, conversion rate 1.7, tariff rate 8%. Commodity 2: 250 units at 300 credits per unit, conversion rate 1.5, tariff rate 5%. Commodity 3: 100 units at 400 credits per unit, conversion rate 2.0, tariff rate 10%. Calculate the final trade value for each commodity and answer the highest value.
INFO - Tools Description: You have access to the following tools:
[1] convert_currency: Converts the commodity price to local currency. Arguments: base_price (float), conversion_rate (float)
    Signature: convert_currency(base_price: float, conversion_rate: float) -> float
[2] calculate_tariff: Calculates the trade tariff based on the converted price. Arguments: price (float), tariff_rate (float, in %)
    Signature: calculate_tariff(price: float, tariff_rate: float) -> float
[3] estimate_final_value: Estimates the final trade value including the tariff. Arguments: price (float), tariff (float)
    Signature: estimate_final_value(price: float, tariff: float) -> float
[4] calculator: Evaluates the given expression and returns the result. Accepts a calculation expression as input. For example, "2 + (3 * 4)" will return 14.
    Signature: calculator(expression: str) -> float
[5] find_minimum: Finds the minimum value among the given arguments. Accepts variable number of float arguments.
    Signature: find_minimum(*args: float) -> float
[6] find_maximum: Finds the maximum value among the given arguments. Accepts variable number of float arguments.
    Signature: find_maximum(*args: float) -> float

INFO - Agent Output: Thought: To find the most profitable trade route, we first need to calculate the final trade value for each commodity. This involves converting the commodity price to local currency, calculating the tariff, and then estimating the final trade value. We'll start with Commodity 1.
