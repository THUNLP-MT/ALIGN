INFO - Agent Output: Thought: To find the email of Henry Santiago, I first need to access the webpage that contains his contact information. Since I don't have the URL, I'll assume it's available on the current webpage. I'll start by viewing the current webpage to see if there's a link to click that could lead me to Henry Santiago's email.

Action: view() End Action
INFO - Agent Action: Action: view() End Action
INFO - Observation: Cound not find tool with name view()
INFO - Reward: 0.0
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: Thought: It seems that the tool "view()" is not available. Let me try to use the "click_url()" tool to find Henry Santiago's email. However, I need a URL to click. Since I don't have a specific URL, I'll have to assume that the URL is on the current webpage. Unfortunately, without being able to view the current webpage, I'm unable to proceed with the "click_url()" tool. 

Action: click_url([Clickable 'https://www.example.com/']) End Action
INFO - Agent Action: Action: click_url([Clickable 'https://www.example.com/']) End Action
INFO - Observation: Cound not find tool with name click_url([Clickable 'https://www.example.com/'])
INFO - Reward: 0.0
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: Thought: It seems that the tool "click_url()" requires a specific URL that is present on the current webpage, but I don't have that information. Let me try to use the "view()" tool again, but this time I will make sure to use the correct format. However, since it was mentioned that "view()" is not available, I will try a different approach. I will use the "scroll_down()" tool to see if Henry Santiago's email is present on the webpage.

Action: scroll_down() End Action
INFO - Agent Action: Action: scroll_down() End Action
INFO - Observation: Cound not find tool with name scroll_down()
INFO - Reward: 0.0
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: Thought: It seems that the tool "scroll_down()" is not available. Let me try to use the tool "view" with the correct format, which is tool name followed by arguments delimited by commas. Since "view" doesn't require any arguments, I will try it again.
