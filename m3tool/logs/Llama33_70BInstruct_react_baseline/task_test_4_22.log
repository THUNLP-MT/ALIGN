INFO - Agent Output: Thought: To find the total price of the items, I first need to know the prices of each item. Since I don't have that information, I should look for a way to find or calculate these prices. However, the problem doesn't specify where to find these prices or how they are calculated. Given the tools available, it seems like the calculator could be useful if I had the prices or a formula to calculate the total price. But first, I need to find out the prices of Ancient Wand, Mystical Wand, and Enchanted Potion.

However, since I also need the price of the "Enchanted Potion", I should ideally find a way to navigate between the wand and potion pages efficiently.
