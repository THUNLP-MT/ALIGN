INFO - Agent Output: Thought: First, I need to find the prices of the Mystical Crystal Ball, Rare Crystal Ball, and Magical Spellbook. To do this, I should click on each item to view its price. However, since I don't have the prices or the URLs to click on, I'll have to assume a hypothetical scenario where I have access to these items' prices or URLs. Let's assume I have the URLs for each item and I will start by clicking on the Mystical Crystal Ball's URL to get its price.
