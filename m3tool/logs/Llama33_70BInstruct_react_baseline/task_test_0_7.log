INFO - ========== Task Name: message_decoder/maximum_value_decoding | Task ID: 0-7 ==========
INFO - Task: Decode a list of hex-encoded messages using a Caesar cipher with a shift of 4, reverse them, and find the numerical maximum value of these decoded strings. Assume the decoded strings represent integers. The hex-encoded messages are ['313233', '343536', '373839'].
INFO - Tools Description: You have access to the following tools:
[1] convert_hex_to_ascii: Converts a hexadecimal string to ASCII. Arguments: hex_string (str)
    Signature: convert_hex_to_ascii(hex_string: str) -> str
[2] reverse_string: Reverses a string. Arguments: string (str)
    Signature: reverse_string(string: str) -> str
[3] caesar_decode: Decodes a string using the Caesar cipher. Arguments: message (str), shift (int)
    Signature: caesar_decode(message: str, shift: int) -> str
[4] string_length: Finds the length of a string. Arguments: string (str)
    Signature: string_length(string: str) -> int
[5] minimum_value: Finds the minimum value from given arguments. Arguments: *args (variable number of arguments)
    Signature: minimum_value(*args) -> int/float
[6] maximum_value: Finds the maximum value from given arguments. Arguments: *args (variable number of arguments)
    Signature: maximum_value(*args) -> int/float

INFO - Agent Output: Thought: First, we need to convert the hex-encoded messages to ASCII. We can start by converting the first message '313233' to ASCII using the convert_hex_to_ascii tool.

Action: convert_hex_to_ascii, 313233 End Action
INFO - Agent Action: Action: convert_hex_to_ascii, 313233 End Action
INFO - Observation: 123
INFO - Reward: 0.0
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: Thought: Now that we have the ASCII representation of the first message, which is '123', we need to apply the Caesar cipher with a shift of 4 to decode it. We will use the caesar_decode tool for this purpose.

Action: caesar_decode, 123, 4 End Action
INFO - Agent Action: Action: caesar_decode, 123, 4 End Action
INFO - Observation: Failed to execute tool caesar_decode with args (123, 4). Did you try to invoke more than one tool at a time?
INFO - Reward: 0.0
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: Thought: The error occurred because the caesar_decode tool expects a string as the first argument, but I provided an integer. I should convert the integer to a string first. However, since the task involves multiple steps including decoding all messages, reversing them, and finding the maximum value, let's continue with converting the next hex-encoded message to ASCII. The next message is '343536'.

Action: convert_hex_to_ascii, 343536 End Action
INFO - Agent Action: Action: convert_hex_to_ascii, 343536 End Action
INFO - Observation: 456
INFO - Reward: 0.0
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: Thought: Now that we have the ASCII representation of the second message, which is '456', we need to convert the last hex-encoded message to ASCII. The last message is '373839'.

Action: convert_hex_to_ascii, 373839 End Action
INFO - Agent Action: Action: convert_hex_to_ascii, 373839 End Action
INFO - Observation: 789
INFO - Reward: 0.0
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: Thought: We now have all the ASCII representations of the messages: '123', '456', and '789'. Next, we should apply the Caesar cipher with a shift of 4 to each of these messages. However, since the caesar_decode tool requires a string and an integer shift, and we've established that our messages are numeric strings, we can proceed with decoding '123' as a string.

INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: Thought: The error occurred because the caesar_decode tool expects a string as the first argument, but I provided an integer. I should convert the integer to a string first. Let me try again by converting '123' to a string and then applying the Caesar cipher.

Action: caesar_decode, '123', 4 End Action

INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: Thought: The Caesar cipher with a shift of 4 has been applied to '123', resulting in '123'. Next, I need to apply the same shift to the other messages, '456' and '789'. Let's apply the Caesar cipher to '456'.

Action: caesar_decode, 456, 4 End Action
INFO - Agent Action: Action: caesar_decode, 456, 4 End Action

INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: Thought: The error occurred again because I provided an integer instead of a string. I should convert '456' to a string first. Let me try again by converting '456' to a string and then applying the Caesar cipher.

Action: caesar_decode, '456', 4 End Action

INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: Thought: The Caesar cipher with a shift of 4 has been applied to '456', resulting in '456'. Next, I need to apply the same shift to the last message, '789'. Let's apply the Caesar cipher to '789'.

INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: Thought: The Caesar cipher with a shift of 4 has been applied to all messages, resulting in '123', '456', and '789'. Since the Caesar cipher didn't change the messages, we can proceed with reversing these strings. Let's reverse '123'.

Action: reverse_string, '123' End Action
