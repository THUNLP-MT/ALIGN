INFO - Agent Output: Thought: I need to find the email of Kimberly Dudley, but I don't have any information about her. I should try to find a directory or a webpage that contains her contact information. Since I couldn't use the "view" tool, let me try to use the "click_url" tool to navigate to a webpage that might have her email address. However, I don't have a specific URL to click. I'll have to try a different approach.

INFO - Agent Output: Thought: I have accessed the "Meet Our Team" page, but it seems to be a directory of different teams within the company. Since I don't know which team Kimberly Dudley belongs to, I'll have to make an educated guess. The "Marketing Team" or "Customer Support Team" might be a good place to start, as these teams often have contact information available. Let's try the "Marketing Team" first.
