INFO - Observation: Failed to execute tool budget_calculator with args ('580 + 450 + 250', '100 + 150 + 135', '2 + 3 + 2'). Did you try to invoke more than one tool at a time?
INFO - Reward: 0.0
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: Thought: I need to calculate the total budget for the trip. First, I should calculate the total flight cost, which is the sum of the individual flight costs.

Action: sum, 580, 450, 250 End Action
INFO - Agent Action: Action: sum, 580, 450, 250 End Action
INFO - Observation: 1280
INFO - Reward: 0.0
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: Thought: I have the total flight cost, which is $1280. Next, I need to calculate the total hotel cost per night, which is the average of the individual hotel costs per night, but since the stay duration varies, I should directly calculate the total hotel cost for each location and then sum them up. The total hotel cost for "C" is $200, for "B" is $450, and for "D" is $270. I should sum these costs.

Action: sum, 200, 450, 270 End Action
INFO - Agent Action: Action: sum, 200, 450, 270 End Action
INFO - Observation: 920
INFO - Reward: 0.0
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: Thought: I have the total hotel cost, which is $920. Now, I can calculate the total budget for the trip using the budget_calculator tool, considering the total flight cost ($1280), the total hotel cost per night is not needed since we already have the total hotel cost, and the total number of nights is 7 (2+3+2).

Action: budget_calculator, 1280, 920 / 7, 7 End Action
INFO - Agent Action: Action: budget_calculator, 1280, 920 / 7, 7 End Action
INFO - Observation: Failed to execute tool budget_calculator with args (1280, '920 / 7', 7). Did you try to invoke more than one tool at a time?
