Now, I have all the costs: the flights from "E" to "A" and "A" to "D" cost 450 and 250 respectively, the hotel in "A" costs 150 for 3 nights, and the hotel in "D" costs 260 for 2 nights. I can now calculate the total budget for the trip using the budget_calculator tool.

INFO - Agent Output: Thought: I need to calculate the total cost of the flights first, which is 450 + 250 = 700. Then, I need to calculate the total budget for the trip, which includes the cost of the flights, the hotel in "A" for 3 nights, and the hotel in "D" for 2 nights. The total cost of the hotels is 50 * 3 + 130 * 2 = 150 + 260 = 410 for the hotels, but I should use the budget_calculator tool with the correct total flight price and the price per night for each hotel separately to get the accurate total budget.

Now, I need to calculate the total budget for the trip to "D", which includes the cost of the flight from "A" to "D" and the hotel in "D" for 2 nights. I already know the cost of the flight from "A" to "D" is 250 and the hotel in "D" costs 130 per night. So, I should use the budget_calculator tool with the correct total flight price and the price per night for the hotel in "D" to get the accurate total budget for the second part of the trip.
