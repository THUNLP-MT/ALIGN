INFO - Agent Action: The input '7a686b7a686d666d686b' is a hexadecimal string, not a hex string that starts with '0x'. It seems that the tool convert_hex_to_ascii is designed to handle hexadecimal strings that start with '0x'. 

However, I can convert the hexadecimal string to ASCII by removing the '0x' prefix and then using the tool convert_hex_to_ascii. But in this case, I can directly use the tool convert_hex_to_ascii without removing the '0x' prefix.

Since the input '7a686b7a686d666d686b' is not a valid hexadecimal string that starts with '0x', I will assume it's a hexadecimal string without '0x' prefix.

This is because '7a686b7a686d666d686b' is a hexadecimal string. To convert it to ASCII, we need to remove the '0x' prefix. However, since we can't invoke the tool with the '0x' prefix, we can remove the '0x' prefix manually.

First, we need to remove the '0x' prefix from the hexadecimal string. Then we can convert the hexadecimal string to ASCII.
