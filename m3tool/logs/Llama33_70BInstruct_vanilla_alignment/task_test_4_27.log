INFO - Agent Action: To find the total price of the items after applying a 10% discount, I first need to know the prices of the Ancient Crystal Ball and the Rare Wand. However, since the prices are not provided in the question, I will assume hypothetical prices for demonstration purposes. Let's say the Ancient Crystal Ball costs $100 and the Rare Wand costs $200.

1. Calculate the total price before the discount: $100 (Ancient Crystal Ball) + $200 (Rare Wand) = $300.
2. Apply a 10% discount on the total price: 10% of $300 = 0.10 * $300 = $30.
3. Subtract the discount from the total price to get the final price: $300 - $30 = $270.

Since the actual prices of the items are not given, I will use the calculator tool with the assumed prices to demonstrate the calculation of the final price after applying the discount.
