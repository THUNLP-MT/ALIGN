INFO - Agent Action: To find the total price of the items after applying a 10% discount, I first need to know the prices of the Ancient Wand and the Enchanted Potion. However, since the prices are not provided, I will assume hypothetical prices for demonstration purposes. Let's say the Ancient Wand costs $100 and the Enchanted Potion costs $50.

1. Calculate the total price before the discount: $100 (Ancient Wand) + $50 (Enchanted Potion) = $150.
2. Apply a 10% discount on the total price: 10% of $150 = 0.10 * $150 = $15.
3. Subtract the discount from the total price to get the final price: $150 - $15 = $135.

Since the actual prices of the items are not given, I will use the calculator tool with the assumed prices to demonstrate the calculation of the final price after applying the discount.

Action: calculator, "100 + 50 - (0.1 * (100 + 50))" End Action
