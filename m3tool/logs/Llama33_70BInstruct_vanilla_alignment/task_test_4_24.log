INFO - Agent Action: To find the total price of the items after applying a 10% discount, I first need to know the prices of the Legendary Wand, Enchanted Potion, and Magical Spellbook. However, since the prices are not provided, I will assume hypothetical prices for demonstration purposes. Let's say the prices are as follows: Legendary Wand = $100, Enchanted Potion = $20, Magical Spellbook = $50.

First, calculate the total price before the discount: $100 + $20 + $50 = $170.

Then, apply a 10% discount on the total price: 10% of $170 = 0.10 * $170 = $17.

Subtract the discount from the total price to get the final price: $170 - $17 = $153.

Since the actual prices of the items are not given, I will use the calculator tool with the assumed total price and discount percentage for demonstration. However, please note that in a real scenario, you would use the actual prices of the items.
