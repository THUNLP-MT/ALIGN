INFO - Plan: Plan: First, I will view the current webpage to see if Allison Hill's phone number is already displayed. Then, I will scroll down the webpage to see if the phone number is further down the page. If still not found, I will scroll up to return to the top of the page and look for a link or button to click that may lead to a contact or directory page where I can find Allison Hill's phone number, and if I find such a link, I will click on it using the click_url tool. If after clicking the link I am taken to a new page, I will view the new page to see if the phone number is displayed, and if not, I will repeat the process of scrolling down and up until I find the phone number or until there are no more links or buttons to click.
