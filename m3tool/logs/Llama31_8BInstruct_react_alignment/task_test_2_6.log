INFO - ========== Task Name: trade_calculator/comparative_profit_analysis | Task ID: 2-6 ==========
INFO - Task: Analyze the profit margins for selling two different commodities in an intergalactic market. The first commodity has a base price of 100 credits per unit, a conversion rate of 1.6, a tariff rate of 6%, and a quantity of 300 units. The second commodity has a base price of 80 credits per unit, a conversion rate of 1.8, a tariff rate of 5%, and a quantity of 500 units. Determine the maximum final trade values among these commodities.
INFO - Tools Description: You have access to the following tools:
[1] convert_currency: Converts the commodity price to local currency. Arguments: base_price (float), conversion_rate (float)
    Signature: convert_currency(base_price: float, conversion_rate: float) -> float
[2] calculate_tariff: Calculates the trade tariff based on the converted price. Arguments: price (float), tariff_rate (float, in %)
    Signature: calculate_tariff(price: float, tariff_rate: float) -> float
[3] estimate_final_value: Estimates the final trade value including the tariff. Arguments: price (float), tariff (float)
    Signature: estimate_final_value(price: float, tariff: float) -> float
[4] calculator: Evaluates the given expression and returns the result. Accepts a calculation expression as input. For example, "2 + (3 * 4)" will return 14.
    Signature: calculator(expression: str) -> float
[5] find_minimum: Finds the minimum value among the given arguments. Accepts variable number of float arguments.
    Signature: find_minimum(*args: float) -> float
[6] find_maximum: Finds the maximum value among the given arguments. Accepts variable number of float arguments.
    Signature: find_maximum(*args: float) -> float

INFO - Agent Output: Thought: To find the maximum final trade values, we need to first convert the base prices to local currency, then calculate the tariff for each commodity, and finally estimate the final trade value for each commodity.
