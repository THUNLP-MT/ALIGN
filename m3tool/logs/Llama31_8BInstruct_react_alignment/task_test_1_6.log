INFO - Agent Output: Thought: To solve this problem, we need to first transcribe the DNA sequence to mRNA, then translate the mRNA sequence to an amino acid sequence, and finally check if 'Methionine' is in the amino acid sequence.

Thought: Since we don't have a tool to find 'Methionine' in the amino acid sequence, we will use a custom function to check if 'Methionine' is in the sequence.
