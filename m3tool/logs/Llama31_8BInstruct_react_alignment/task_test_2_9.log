INFO - ========== Task Name: trade_calculator/seasonal_price_fluctuation_impact | Task ID: 2-9 ==========
INFO - Task: Assess the impact of seasonal price fluctuations on trade value. A trader is dealing with a commodity whose base price varies seasonally: 200 credits in summer, 250 credits in autumn, 180 credits in winter. The quantity is 200 units, the conversion rate is 1.8, and the tariff rate is 7%. Calculate the final trade values for each season and list them in the order of summer, autumn, winter.Example: 'Answer: [1000, 2000, 3000]'
INFO - Tools Description: You have access to the following tools:
[1] convert_currency: Converts the commodity price to local currency. Arguments: base_price (float), conversion_rate (float)
    Signature: convert_currency(base_price: float, conversion_rate: float) -> float
[2] calculate_tariff: Calculates the trade tariff based on the converted price. Arguments: price (float), tariff_rate (float, in %)
    Signature: calculate_tariff(price: float, tariff_rate: float) -> float
[3] estimate_final_value: Estimates the final trade value including the tariff. Arguments: price (float), tariff (float)
    Signature: estimate_final_value(price: float, tariff: float) -> float
[4] calculator: Evaluates the given expression and returns the result. Accepts a calculation expression as input. For example, "2 + (3 * 4)" will return 14.
    Signature: calculator(expression: str) -> float
[5] find_minimum: Finds the minimum value among the given arguments. Accepts variable number of float arguments.
    Signature: find_minimum(*args: float) -> float
[6] find_maximum: Finds the maximum value among the given arguments. Accepts variable number of float arguments.
    Signature: find_maximum(*args: float) -> float

INFO - Agent Output: Thought: To calculate the final trade values for each season, we need to first convert the base prices to local currency, then calculate the trade tariff, and finally estimate the final trade value.
