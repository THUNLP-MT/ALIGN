INFO - ========== Task Name: cryptobotanists_plant_dna_sequencer/find_most_common_nucleotide_combined_sequence | Task ID: 1-7 ==========
INFO - Task: Combine the DNA sequences ['AGCT', 'CCGA', 'TTAG'] and find the most common nucleotide in the combined sequence.
INFO - Tools Description: You have access to the following tools:
[1] count_nucleotides: Counts the occurrences of each nucleotide in a DNA sequence. Arguments: dna_sequence (str)
    Signature: count_nucleotides(dna_sequence: str) -> dict
[2] transcribe_dna_to_mrna: Transcribes DNA sequence to mRNA. Arguments: dna_sequence (str)
    Signature: transcribe_dna_to_mrna(dna_sequence: str) -> str
[3] translate_mrna_to_amino_acid: Translates mRNA sequence to a chain of amino acids. Arguments: mrna_sequence (str)
    Signature: translate_mrna_to_amino_acid(mrna_sequence: str) -> str
[4] find_max_nucleotide: Return the nucleotide (str) with the maximum count (int). Arguments: nucleotide_counts in the form of (k1, v1, k2, v2, ..., kn, vn)
    Signature: find_max_nucleotide(*args) -> (str, int)
[5] is_valid_dna_sequence: Checks if the DNA sequence is valid. Arguments: dna_sequence (str)
    Signature: is_valid_dna_sequence(dna_sequence: str) -> bool
[6] reverse_transcribe_mrna_to_dna: Reverse transcribes mRNA sequence to DNA. Arguments: mrna_sequence (str)
    Signature: reverse_transcribe_mrna_to_dna(mrna_sequence: str) -> str

INFO - Agent Output: Thought: To find the most common nucleotide in the combined sequence, I need to first combine the DNA sequences and then count the occurrences of each nucleotide.

Action: count_nucleotides, AGCT,CCGA,TTAG End Action
INFO - Agent Action: Action: count_nucleotides, AGCT,CCGA,TTAG End Action
INFO - Observation: Failed to execute tool count_nucleotides with args ('AGCT', 'CCGA', 'TTAG'). Did you try to invoke more than one tool at a time?
INFO - Reward: 0.0
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: Thought: I need to combine the DNA sequences first, then count the nucleotides. I will use the '+' operator to concatenate the sequences.

Action: count_nucleotides, AGCT+CCGA+TTAG End Action
INFO - Agent Action: Action: count_nucleotides, AGCT+CCGA+TTAG End Action
INFO - Observation: {'A': 3, 'G': 3, 'C': 3, 'T': 3, '+': 2}
INFO - Reward: 0.0
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: Thought: The result includes the '+' character, which is not a valid nucleotide. I need to remove it from the count.

Action: find_max_nucleotide, A,3,G,3,C,3,T,3 End Action
INFO - Agent Action: Action: find_max_nucleotide, A,3,G,3,C,3,T,3 End Action
INFO - Observation: ('A', 3)
INFO - Reward: 0.0
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: Thought: Now that I have the most common nucleotide, I can find its count in the original combined sequence.

Action: count_nucleotides, AGCT+CCGA+TTAG End Action
INFO - Agent Action: Action: count_nucleotides, AGCT+CCGA+TTAG End Action
INFO - Observation: {'A': 3, 'G': 3, 'C': 3, 'T': 3, '+': 2}
INFO - Reward: 0.0
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: Thought: The count of the most common nucleotide 'A' is not present in the result. I need to find the count of 'A' in the original combined sequence.

Action: count_nucleotides, AGCT End Action
INFO - Agent Action: Action: count_nucleotides, AGCT End Action
INFO - Observation: {'A': 1, 'G': 1, 'C': 1, 'T': 1}
INFO - Reward: 0.0
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: Thought: Since the count of 'A' in the sequence 'AGCT' is 1, and the combined sequence has 3 'A's, I can infer that the count of 'A' in the combined sequence 'AGCT+CCGA+TTAG' is 3.

Answer: {'A': 3}
INFO - Agent Action: Answer: {'A': 3}
INFO - Observation: Incorrect! The expected output is: ('A', 3)
INFO - Reward: 0
INFO - Done: True
