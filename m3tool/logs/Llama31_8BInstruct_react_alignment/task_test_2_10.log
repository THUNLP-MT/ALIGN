INFO - ========== Task Name: trade_calculator/balancing_multiple_trade_offers | Task ID: 2-10 ==========
INFO - Task: A trader has to balance multiple trade offers to maximize profit. Offer 1: Sell 300 units at 250 credits per unit, conversion rate 1.6, tariff rate 6%. Offer 2: Buy 150 units at 220 credits per unit, conversion rate 1.5, tariff rate 4%. Determine the net profit or loss by subtracting the total cost of Offer 2 from the total revenue of Offer 1.
INFO - Tools Description: You have access to the following tools:
[1] convert_currency: Converts the commodity price to local currency. Arguments: base_price (float), conversion_rate (float)
    Signature: convert_currency(base_price: float, conversion_rate: float) -> float
[2] calculate_tariff: Calculates the trade tariff based on the converted price. Arguments: price (float), tariff_rate (float, in %)
    Signature: calculate_tariff(price: float, tariff_rate: float) -> float
[3] estimate_final_value: Estimates the final trade value including the tariff. Arguments: price (float), tariff (float)
    Signature: estimate_final_value(price: float, tariff: float) -> float
[4] calculator: Evaluates the given expression and returns the result. Accepts a calculation expression as input. For example, "2 + (3 * 4)" will return 14.
    Signature: calculator(expression: str) -> float
[5] find_minimum: Finds the minimum value among the given arguments. Accepts variable number of float arguments.
    Signature: find_minimum(*args: float) -> float
[6] find_maximum: Finds the maximum value among the given arguments. Accepts variable number of float arguments.
    Signature: find_maximum(*args: float) -> float

INFO - Agent Output: Thought: To determine the net profit or loss, we need to calculate the total revenue of Offer 1 and the total cost of Offer 2, then subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

Thought: First, we need to convert the price of Offer 1 to local currency using the conversion rate.

Action: convert_currency, 250.0, 1.6 End Action

Thought: Next, we need to calculate the total revenue of Offer 1 by multiplying the converted price by the number of units.
