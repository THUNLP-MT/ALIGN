INFO - Agent Output: Thought: The team page lists different departments but does not directly show the phone number 310-579-9118x38425. The phone number could be associated with any of these teams, but given its format (including an extension), it's more likely to be associated with a specific person or role within a team rather than a general team contact number. Let's try viewing the next page to see if there's more information or if we should start exploring specific teams.
