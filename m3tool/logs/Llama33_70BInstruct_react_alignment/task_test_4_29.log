INFO - Agent Output: Thought: I have found a link directly to the Customer Support Team page. This page likely contains the list of employees in the Customer Support Department, which will allow me to count how many people are in the department. I will click on this link to view the team members.

INFO - Agent Output: Thought: The link to the Customer Support Team page was not found, which means I need to try a different approach. Since I was on the "/team" page, I can try scrolling down to see if there's more content that might be relevant, including possibly a list of teams or employees that didn't fit on the first page.

INFO - Agent Output: Thought: After scrolling down, it seems there's no additional information on the second page of the "/team" section that directly relates to the Customer Support Department or its members. Given this, my next step would be to go back to the previous page, which was the main "/team" page, to reconsider the links provided and see if there's an alternative way to find the information I'm looking for.
