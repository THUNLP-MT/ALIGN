INFO - Agent Output: Thought: I have found a hotel in "C" that matches my preferences, with a price per night of 103. Now, I need to calculate the total budget for the trip, which includes the cost of flights and hotels for all legs of the trip. The total cost of flights is 400 + 490 + 250 = 1140. The total cost of hotels is (135 * 3) + (50 * 2) + (103 * 2) = 405 + 100 + 206 = 711. The total budget for the trip is the sum of the total cost of flights and hotels.

INFO - Agent Action: Action: budget_calculator, 1140, 711, 7 End Action
INFO - Observation: 6117
INFO - Reward: 0.0
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: Thought: The budget_calculator tool does not seem to be used correctly as it requires flight_price, hotel_price_per_night, and num_nights. Let me recalculate the total budget by adding the costs of flights and the total cost of hotels for each leg of the trip separately. 
The total cost of the first leg is 400 (flight) + 135 * 3 (hotel) = 400 + 405 = 805. 
The total cost of the second leg is 490 (flight) + 50 * 2 (hotel) = 490 + 100 = 590. 
The total cost of the third leg is 250 (flight) + 103 * 2 (hotel) = 250 + 206 = 456. 
The total budget for the trip is 805 + 590 + 456 = 1851.
Answer: 1851
