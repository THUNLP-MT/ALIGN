INFO - ========== Task Name: message_decoder/maximum_value_decoding | Task ID: 0-7 ==========
INFO - Task: Decode a list of hex-encoded messages using a Caesar cipher with a shift of 4, reverse them, and find the numerical maximum value of these decoded strings. Assume the decoded strings represent integers. The hex-encoded messages are ['313233', '343536', '373839'].
INFO - Tools Description: You have access to the following tools:
[1] convert_hex_to_ascii: Converts a hexadecimal string to ASCII. Arguments: hex_string (str)
    Signature: convert_hex_to_ascii(hex_string: str) -> str
[2] reverse_string: Reverses a string. Arguments: string (str)
    Signature: reverse_string(string: str) -> str
[3] caesar_decode: Decodes a string using the Caesar cipher. Arguments: message (str), shift (int)
    Signature: caesar_decode(message: str, shift: int) -> str
[4] string_length: Finds the length of a string. Arguments: string (str)
    Signature: string_length(string: str) -> int
[5] minimum_value: Finds the minimum value from given arguments. Arguments: *args (variable number of arguments)
    Signature: minimum_value(*args) -> int/float
[6] maximum_value: Finds the maximum value from given arguments. Arguments: *args (variable number of arguments)
    Signature: maximum_value(*args) -> int/float

INFO - Agent Output: Thought: First, I need to convert the hexadecimal strings to ASCII. I will start with the first message '313233'.

INFO - Observation: Error executing tool 'reverse_string'. This tool expects a standard text string as input, not a hexadecimal string. Did you remember to convert the hex string to ASCII using 'convert_hex_to_ascii' first? The required sequence is Hex -> ASCII -> Reverse -> Caesar Decode.
INFO - Reward: 0.0
INFO - Done: False
INFO - Log contents when executing `WrapStep`: WARNING - Message Decoder tool 'reverse_string' failed (reward=0) and input '123' looks like hex. Providing specific feedback.


INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: Thought: The error message indicates that the input was not a standard text string, but since I already converted '313233' to ASCII and got '123', I should proceed with reversing '123'. However, it seems there was a misunderstanding in the error message since '123' is indeed a standard text string resulting from the hex conversion. I will proceed with reversing '123' as it is the correct step after converting to ASCII.

INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: Thought: It seems like there's a repeated error message, but I've already established that '123' is the ASCII conversion of '313233' and is a standard text string. To move forward, I'll ignore the error for now and proceed with the next hex string '343536' by converting it to ASCII first.

INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: Thought: I've converted '343536' to ASCII and got '456'. Since '456' is a standard text string, I should be able to reverse it. However, to avoid another error, I will try converting the last hex string '373839' to ASCII first.
