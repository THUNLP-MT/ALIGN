INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: Thought: The team page lists different departments but does not directly show team members. Since I'm looking for a specific person, Kimberly Dudley, and I don't know which department she belongs to, I should try to find a department that might have contact information or a list of employees. The "Customer Support Team" might be a good place to start, as they often have publicly available contact information.

INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: Thought: The URL for the "Customer Support Team" was not found. This might mean that the link is incorrect or the page does not exist. I should try another department. Let's try the "Marketing Team" as they also might have contact information or a list of team members.
