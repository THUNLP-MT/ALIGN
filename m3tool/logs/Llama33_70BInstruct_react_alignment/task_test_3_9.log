INFO - Agent Output: Thought: To plan the trip, I first need to find the cheapest flights from "E" to "A" on 2023-12-25 and then from "A" to "D" on 2023-12-28. I will start by finding flights from "E" to "A" on 2023-12-25.

INFO - Agent Output: Thought: I have found the cheapest flight from "E" to "A" on 2023-12-25, which costs 450. Next, I need to find the cheapest flight from "A" to "D" on 2023-12-28.

INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: Thought: I have found the cheapest flights for both legs of the trip. The flight from "E" to "A" costs 450 and the flight from "A" to "D" costs 250. Next, I need to find the cheapest hotels for the stay in "A" and "D". I will start by finding hotels in "A".

INFO - Reward: 0.0
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: Thought: I have found hotels in "A" and the cheapest one costs 50 per night. Since I will be staying in "A" for 3 nights, the total cost for the hotel in "A" will be 50 * 3 = 150. Next, I need to find the cheapest hotels for the stay in "D".

INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: Thought: I have found hotels in "D" and the cheapest one costs 130 per night. Since I will be staying in "D" for 2 nights, the total cost for the hotel in "D" will be 130 * 2 = 260. Now, I have all the costs: flight from "E" to "A" (450), flight from "A" to "D" (250), hotel in "A" (150), and hotel in "D" (260). I can calculate the total budget for the trip using the budget_calculator tool.

INFO - Agent Action: Action: budget_calculator, 450 + 250, 50, 3 End Action
INFO - Observation: Failed to execute tool budget_calculator with args ('450 + 250', 50, 3). Did you try to invoke more than one tool at a time?
INFO - Reward: 0.0
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: Thought: I need to calculate the total cost of flights first, which is 450 + 250 = 700. Then, I need to calculate the total budget for the trip, which includes the cost of flights (700), the cost of the hotel in "A" for 3 nights (50 * 3 = 150), and the cost of the hotel in "D" for 2 nights (130 * 2 = 260). I will use the budget_calculator tool with the correct arguments.
Action: budget_calculator, 700, 150 + 260, 5 End Action
INFO - Agent Action: Action: budget_calculator, 700, 150 + 260, 5 End Action
INFO - Observation: Failed to execute tool budget_calculator with args (700, '150 + 260', 5). Did you try to invoke more than one tool at a time?
INFO - Reward: 0.0
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: Thought: I need to calculate the total cost of hotels first, which is 150 for "A" and 260 for "D", so the total hotel cost per night is not needed, I just need the total hotel cost for the entire trip. The total hotel cost is 150 + 260 = 410. The flight cost is 450 + 250 = 700. I will use the budget_calculator tool with the correct arguments, but first I need to calculate the total hotel cost per night, which is not needed, instead I will calculate the total trip cost by adding the flight cost and the hotel cost for the entire trip, since the budget_calculator requires the flight price, hotel price per night and the number of nights. However, I can calculate the total cost by adding the flight cost and the total hotel cost for the entire trip.
