INFO - Agent Output: Thought: To find the total price of the items after applying a 10% discount, we first need to know the prices of the Ancient Wand and the Enchanted Potion. However, the prices are not provided in the question. Let's assume the prices are $100 for the Ancient Wand and $50 for the Enchanted Potion for calculation purposes. The total price before the discount is $100 + $50 = $150. Applying a 10% discount means we need to calculate 10% of $150 and subtract it from $150.

INFO - Agent Output: Thought: Now that we know the discount amount is $15.00, we can calculate the total price after applying the discount. The total price before the discount is $150, and subtracting the discount gives us $150 - $15.00 = $135.00.

Action: calculator, 150 - 15.0 End Action
