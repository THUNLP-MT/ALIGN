However, the "Meet Our Team" link could potentially lead to a page that lists all employees, including Henry Santiago, along with their respective departments.

INFO - Agent Output: Thought: The team page lists various departments within MagicWand Co. but does not specify which department Henry Santiago belongs to. To find this information, I would need to explore each department's page individually. However, since I don't know which department Henry Santiago is in, I should first try to find a page that might list all employees across different departments or provide a search function. Given the current options, scrolling down might reveal more teams or a search function.

INFO - Agent Output: Thought: After scrolling down, it seems there's no additional information or a search function on the current page that could help me find Henry Santiago's department directly. My next step should be to explore each department page for a list of team members or any mention of Henry Santiago. Starting with the "Engineering Team" might be a good approach since it's often a large department in companies involved in crafting and technology.

INFO - Agent Output: Thought: The Engineering Team page lists specific team members, but Henry Santiago is not among them. Since I've exhausted the options on this page and didn't find the information I'm looking for, I should go back to the teams page to explore other departments, such as the Marketing Team, Sales Team, or Customer Support Team, to see if Henry Santiago is listed under any of those.
