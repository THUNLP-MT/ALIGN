INFO - Agent Output: Thought: First, I need to find the prices of the Mystical Crystal Ball and the Magical Spellbook. Since the prices are not provided, I will assume hypothetical prices for demonstration purposes. Let's say the price of the Mystical Crystal Ball is $20 and the Magical Spellbook is $30. The total price before the discount is $20 + $30 = $50. To apply a 10% discount, I will calculate 10% of $50 and subtract it from $50.

Action: calculator, 50 * 0.1 End Action
