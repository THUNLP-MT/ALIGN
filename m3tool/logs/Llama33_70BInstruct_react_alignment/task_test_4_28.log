INFO - Agent Output: Thought: The Sales Team page lists individual team members with clickable links to their profiles. However, to determine the total number of people in the Sales Department, we don't necessarily need to click on each profile. The list provided on this page already gives us the names of the team members. We should count the names listed here and also consider if there might be more members listed on the next page, if available.
