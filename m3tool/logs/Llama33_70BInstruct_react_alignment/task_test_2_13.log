INFO - ========== Task Name: trade_calculator/optimizing_bulk_purchase_discounts | Task ID: 2-13 ==========
INFO - Task: A trader can benefit from bulk purchase discounts: 5% off for orders of 1000 units or more. Evaluate two commodities: Commodity A (base price 150 credits per unit) and Commodity B (base price 180 credits per unit). Assess the final trade value for purchasing 950 units and 1050 units of each commodity, with a conversion rate of 1.6 and a tariff rate of 7%.Determine the maximum final trade value among the four options.
INFO - Tools Description: You have access to the following tools:
[1] convert_currency: Converts the commodity price to local currency. Arguments: base_price (float), conversion_rate (float)
    Signature: convert_currency(base_price: float, conversion_rate: float) -> float
[2] calculate_tariff: Calculates the trade tariff based on the converted price. Arguments: price (float), tariff_rate (float, in %)
    Signature: calculate_tariff(price: float, tariff_rate: float) -> float
[3] estimate_final_value: Estimates the final trade value including the tariff. Arguments: price (float), tariff (float)
    Signature: estimate_final_value(price: float, tariff: float) -> float
[4] calculator: Evaluates the given expression and returns the result. Accepts a calculation expression as input. For example, "2 + (3 * 4)" will return 14.
    Signature: calculator(expression: str) -> float
[5] find_minimum: Finds the minimum value among the given arguments. Accepts variable number of float arguments.
    Signature: find_minimum(*args: float) -> float
[6] find_maximum: Finds the maximum value among the given arguments. Accepts variable number of float arguments.
    Signature: find_maximum(*args: float) -> float

INFO - Agent Output: Thought: First, we need to calculate the price for 950 units and 1050 units of Commodity A and Commodity B after applying the bulk purchase discount. For 950 units, there is no discount, but for 1050 units, a 5% discount is applied. Then, we convert the price to the local currency using the given conversion rate. After that, we calculate the tariff based on the converted price and the tariff rate. Finally, we estimate the final trade value including the tariff for each option and determine the maximum final trade value among the four options.
