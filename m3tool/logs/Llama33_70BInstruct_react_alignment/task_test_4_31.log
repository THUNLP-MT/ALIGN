INFO - Agent Output: Thought: The "About Us" page provides some background information on MagicWand Co. but does not directly list phone numbers. However, it does offer links to "Meet Our Team" and specifically to the CEO's page. The phone number +1-972-434-3098x05009 might be associated with a specific team member or the CEO, so navigating to the team page could be helpful.

INFO - Agent Output: Thought: The team page lists various departments within MagicWand Co. but does not directly provide phone numbers or names associated with the phone number I'm looking for. Given the options, the Sales Team might be a good place to start, as they often have publicly available contact information. However, to maximize the chance of finding the correct person, I should also consider viewing the next page, if available, to see if there's a direct link to a contact or directory page.
