INFO - ========== Task Name: trade_calculator/variable_tariff_profit_maximization | Task ID: 2-15 ==========
INFO - Task: A trader is exploring profit maximization strategies with variable tariff rates. The commodity price is 300 credits per unit. Compare three selling strategies: 400 units with a 6% tariff, 350 units with a 4% tariff, and 450 units with a 7% tariff. The conversion rate is fixed at 1.7. Determine the maximum final trade value among the three options.
INFO - Tools Description: You have access to the following tools:
[1] convert_currency: Converts the commodity price to local currency. Arguments: base_price (float), conversion_rate (float)
    Signature: convert_currency(base_price: float, conversion_rate: float) -> float
[2] calculate_tariff: Calculates the trade tariff based on the converted price. Arguments: price (float), tariff_rate (float, in %)
    Signature: calculate_tariff(price: float, tariff_rate: float) -> float
[3] estimate_final_value: Estimates the final trade value including the tariff. Arguments: price (float), tariff (float)
    Signature: estimate_final_value(price: float, tariff: float) -> float
[4] calculator: Evaluates the given expression and returns the result. Accepts a calculation expression as input. For example, "2 + (3 * 4)" will return 14.
    Signature: calculator(expression: str) -> float
[5] find_minimum: Finds the minimum value among the given arguments. Accepts variable number of float arguments.
    Signature: find_minimum(*args: float) -> float
[6] find_maximum: Finds the maximum value among the given arguments. Accepts variable number of float arguments.
    Signature: find_maximum(*args: float) -> float

INFO - Agent Output: Thought: First, we need to convert the commodity price to the local currency using the given conversion rate. The commodity price is 300 credits per unit and the conversion rate is 1.7. We will use the convert_currency tool to perform this conversion.

INFO - Reward: 0.0
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: Thought: Now that we have the converted price, which is 510.0, we can calculate the total price for each selling strategy before tariffs. For the first strategy, 400 units are sold, so the total price is 400 * 510.0. We will use the calculator tool to perform this calculation.

INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: Thought: Next, we need to calculate the tariff for the first selling strategy, which has a 6% tariff rate. We will use the calculate_tariff tool to perform this calculation, with the total price from the previous step and the tariff rate.

INFO - Reward: 0.0
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: Thought: Now, we can estimate the final trade value for the first selling strategy by adding the tariff to the total price. We will use the estimate_final_value tool to perform this calculation.

INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: Thought: We need to repeat the same process for the second selling strategy, which involves 350 units and a 4% tariff rate. First, we calculate the total price for 350 units. We will use the calculator tool to perform this calculation.
