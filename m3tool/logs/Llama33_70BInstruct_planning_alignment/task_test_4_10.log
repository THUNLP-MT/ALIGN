INFO - Plan: Plan: First, I will view the current webpage to see if it contains information about Kimberly Dudley's department. Then, I will scroll down the webpage if necessary to find the relevant information. If the information is not found, I will look for a URL that could potentially lead to the department information, such as a 'team' or 'staff' page, and click on it. Next, I will repeat the process of viewing and scrolling down the new webpage until I find the department of Kimberly Dudley. If at any point I need to retrace my steps, I will go back to the previous page. Once I find the department, I will provide the answer in the required format.
