INFO - ========== Task Name: trade_calculator/seasonal_price_fluctuation_impact | Task ID: 2-9 ==========
INFO - Task: Assess the impact of seasonal price fluctuations on trade value. A trader is dealing with a commodity whose base price varies seasonally: 200 credits in summer, 250 credits in autumn, 180 credits in winter. The quantity is 200 units, the conversion rate is 1.8, and the tariff rate is 7%. Calculate the final trade values for each season and list them in the order of summer, autumn, winter.Example: 'Answer: [1000, 2000, 3000]'
INFO - Tools Description: You have access to the following tools:
[1] convert_currency: Converts the commodity price to local currency. Arguments: base_price (float), conversion_rate (float)
    Signature: convert_currency(base_price: float, conversion_rate: float) -> float
[2] calculate_tariff: Calculates the trade tariff based on the converted price. Arguments: price (float), tariff_rate (float, in %)
    Signature: calculate_tariff(price: float, tariff_rate: float) -> float
[3] estimate_final_value: Estimates the final trade value including the tariff. Arguments: price (float), tariff (float)
    Signature: estimate_final_value(price: float, tariff: float) -> float
[4] calculator: Evaluates the given expression and returns the result. Accepts a calculation expression as input. For example, "2 + (3 * 4)" will return 14.
    Signature: calculator(expression: str) -> float
[5] find_minimum: Finds the minimum value among the given arguments. Accepts variable number of float arguments.
    Signature: find_minimum(*args: float) -> float
[6] find_maximum: Finds the maximum value among the given arguments. Accepts variable number of float arguments.
    Signature: find_maximum(*args: float) -> float

INFO - Agent Output: Thought: I need to calculate the final trade value for each season. First, I will calculate the converted price for each season, then the tariff for each converted price, and finally the final trade value including the tariff. I will do this for each season and store the results.
