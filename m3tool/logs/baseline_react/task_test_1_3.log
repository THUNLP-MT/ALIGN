INFO - ========== Task Name: cryptobotanists_plant_dna_sequencer/transcribe_translate_amino_acid_length | Task ID: 1-3 ==========
INFO - Task: Transcribe the DNA sequence 'AGCTAGCGTA' to mRNA, translate it to an amino acid sequence, and determine the length of the amino acid sequence.
INFO - Tools Description: You have access to the following tools:
[1] count_nucleotides: Counts the occurrences of each nucleotide in a DNA sequence. Arguments: dna_sequence (str)
    Signature: count_nucleotides(dna_sequence: str) -> dict
[2] transcribe_dna_to_mrna: Transcribes DNA sequence to mRNA. Arguments: dna_sequence (str)
    Signature: transcribe_dna_to_mrna(dna_sequence: str) -> str
[3] translate_mrna_to_amino_acid: Translates mRNA sequence to a chain of amino acids. Arguments: mrna_sequence (str)
    Signature: translate_mrna_to_amino_acid(mrna_sequence: str) -> str
[4] find_max_nucleotide: Return the nucleotide (str) with the maximum count (int). Arguments: nucleotide_counts in the form of (k1, v1, k2, v2, ..., kn, vn)
    Signature: find_max_nucleotide(*args) -> (str, int)
[5] is_valid_dna_sequence: Checks if the DNA sequence is valid. Arguments: dna_sequence (str)
    Signature: is_valid_dna_sequence(dna_sequence: str) -> bool
[6] reverse_transcribe_mrna_to_dna: Reverse transcribes mRNA sequence to DNA. Arguments: mrna_sequence (str)
    Signature: reverse_transcribe_mrna_to_dna(mrna_sequence: str) -> str

INFO - Agent Output: Thought: I need to transcribe the DNA sequence to mRNA first, then translate the mRNA to an amino acid sequence, and finally determine the length of the amino acid sequence.
Action: transcribe_dna_to_mrna, AGCTAGCGTA End Action
INFO - Agent Action: Action: transcribe_dna_to_mrna, AGCTAGCGTA End Action
INFO - Observation: UCGAUCGCAU
INFO - Reward: 0.0
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: Thought: Now that I have the mRNA sequence, I need to translate it to an amino acid sequence.
Action: translate_mrna_to_amino_acid, UCGAUCGCAU End Action
INFO - Agent Action: Action: translate_mrna_to_amino_acid, UCGAUCGCAU End Action
INFO - Observation: X-X-X-X
INFO - Reward: 0.0
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: Thought: The translation resulted in a sequence of stop codons, which is represented as X. Now, I need to determine the length of this amino acid sequence.
Action: find_max_nucleotide, X, 3, X, 3, X, 3 End Action
INFO - Agent Action: Action: find_max_nucleotide, X, 3, X, 3, X, 3 End Action
INFO - Observation: ('X', 3)
INFO - Reward: 0.0
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: Thought: The length of the amino acid sequence is 3, as it consists of three stop codons represented by 'X'.
Answer: 3
INFO - Agent Action: Answer: 3
INFO - Observation: Incorrect! The expected output is: 4
INFO - Reward: 0
INFO - Done: True
