INFO - ========== Task Name: message_decoder/full_alien_message_decoding | Task ID: 0-0 ==========
INFO - Task: Decode an alien message encoded as follows: first, it's encoded in ASCII; then, it's reversed; and finally, a Caesar cipher with a shift of 5 is applied. The message is '7a686b7a686d666d686b'.
INFO - Tools Description: You have access to the following tools:
[1] convert_hex_to_ascii: Converts a hexadecimal string to ASCII. Arguments: hex_string (str)
    Signature: convert_hex_to_ascii(hex_string: str) -> str
[2] reverse_string: Reverses a string. Arguments: string (str)
    Signature: reverse_string(string: str) -> str
[3] caesar_decode: Decodes a string using the Caesar cipher. Arguments: message (str), shift (int)
    Signature: caesar_decode(message: str, shift: int) -> str
[4] string_length: Finds the length of a string. Arguments: string (str)
    Signature: string_length(string: str) -> int
[5] minimum_value: Finds the minimum value from given arguments. Arguments: *args (variable number of arguments)
    Signature: minimum_value(*args) -> int/float
[6] maximum_value: Finds the maximum value from given arguments. Arguments: *args (variable number of arguments)
    Signature: maximum_value(*args) -> int/float

INFO - Agent Output: Thought: The message is encoded in ASCII, then reversed, and finally encoded with a Caesar cipher with a shift of 5. I need to reverse the message, decode it from ASCII, and then decode it with the Caesar cipher.
