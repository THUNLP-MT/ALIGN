INFO - ========== Task Name: inclined-plane-friction-unnamed-surfaces | Task ID: 16-124 ==========
INFO - Task: This room is called the greenhouse. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a bee hive. The bee hive door is closed. 
	a jug (containing nothing)
	a sink, which is turned off. In the sink is: nothing.
You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
	A door to the outside (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the outside. Then, I will find two inclined planes made of unknown material C and unknown material D. Next, I will collect two identical objects to use in the experiment. After that, I will place one object on each inclined plane and observe which one slides down slower. Finally, I will focus on the inclined plane with the most friction.
