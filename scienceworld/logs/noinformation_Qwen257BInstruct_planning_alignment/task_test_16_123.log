INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will pick up unknown material C and put it on the table. Then, I will pick up unknown material D and put it on the table. Next, I will go to the sink and pick up air. After that, I will use air to blow against unknown material C to make it slide down the table. Then, I will wait for a few seconds to observe the sliding. Next, I will use air to blow against unknown material D to make it slide down the table and wait to observe the sliding. Finally, I will focus on the inclined plane with the least friction.
