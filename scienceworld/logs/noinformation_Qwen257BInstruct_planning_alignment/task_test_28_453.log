INFO - ========== Task Name: test-conductivity-of-unknown-substances | Task ID: 28-453 ==========
INFO - Task: This room is called the greenhouse. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a bee hive. The bee hive door is closed. 
	a jug (containing nothing)
	a sink, which is turned off. In the sink is: nothing.
You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
	A door to the outside (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the workshop to find the unknown substance U. Then, I will de/activate the bee hive to get a sample of unknown substance U. Next, I will use a conductivity tester on the sample to determine if it is electrically conductive. After that, I will go to the greenhouse and place the unknown substance U in the orange box if it is conductive, or in the yellow box if it is not conductive.
INFO - Agent Action: look around
INFO - Observation: This room is called the greenhouse. In it, you see:

INFO - Agent Action: focus on unknown substance U
INFO - Observation: The action 'focus on unknown substance U' was not recognized. This might be because the target object(s) are not present or accessible from your current location/inventory, or the object name is misspelled. Use 'look around' or 'inventory' to check available objects/names, or 'go to' another location if necessary.
