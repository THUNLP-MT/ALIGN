INFO - Agent Action: look at inclined plane H with brick is not a valid action, instead I will try to recall the previous observation of inclined plane H with brick.

Previous observation: an inclined plane H, with: a brick approximately 33% down the plane

Compare with inclined plane B: an inclined plane B, with: a brick approximately 56% down the plane

Since 33% is less than 56%, inclined plane H has the shallowest angle.

focus on inclined plane H
