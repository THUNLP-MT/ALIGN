INFO - ========== Task Name: inclined-plane-friction-unnamed-surfaces | Task ID: 16-124 ==========
INFO - Task: This room is called the greenhouse. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a bee hive. The bee hive door is closed. 
	a jug (containing nothing)
	a sink, which is turned off. In the sink is: nothing.
You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
	A door to the outside (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the outside. Then, I will pick up unknown material C and put it in my inventory. Next, I will go back to the greenhouse. Then, I will pick up the jug and move it to the sink. After that, I will pour unknown material C into the jug. Following this, I will go to the hallway. Then, I will pick up unknown material D and put it in my inventory. After returning to the greenhouse, I will pick up the bee hive and open it. Next, I will pick up the bee hive key and use it on the bee hive. After opening the bee hive, I will pick up the bee hive frame and put it in my inventory. Then, I will go to the outside. Next, I will pick up a flat stone and put it in my inventory. After returning to the greenhouse, I will use the bee hive frame and the flat stone to create an inclined plane for unknown material C. Following this, I will use the bee hive frame and the flat stone to create an inclined plane for unknown material D. Then, I will wait for a sufficient amount of time to observe the motion of the unknown materials on the inclined planes. After observing, I will focus on the inclined plane with the most friction.
INFO - Agent Action: look around
