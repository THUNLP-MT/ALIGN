INFO - ========== Task Name: inclined-plane-determine-angle | Task ID: 14-127 ==========
INFO - Task: This room is called the art studio. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a large cupboard. The large cupboard door is closed. 
	a table. On the table is: a glass cup (containing nothing).
	a wood cup (containing blue paint)
	a wood cup (containing yellow paint)
	a wood cup (containing red paint)
You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the hallway to find the inclined planes B and H. Then, I will use a ruler to measure the height and length of the two inclined planes. Next, I will calculate the angle of each inclined plane using the formula Î¸ = arctan(opposite/adjacent). Finally, I will focus on the inclined plane with the steepest angle.
INFO - Agent Action: look around
