4. Adult
5. Dead

I will now try to describe the life stages of the lemon plant in a more detailed way.

1. Seed: The lemon seed is the beginning of the lemon plant's life cycle. It contains the embryo of the plant and has the potential to grow into a mature lemon tree.
2. Seedling: The seedling stage is when the seed germinates and the first leaves and roots emerge. This stage is critical for the development of the plant.
3. Sapling: The sapling stage is when the seedling grows into a small tree with a well-developed root system and a strong stem.
4. Adult: The adult stage is when the lemon tree reaches its full maturity and produces fruit.
5. Dead: The dead stage is when the lemon tree has reached the end of its life cycle and

INFO - Agent Action: describe life stages of lemon plant 

1. Seed: The lemon seed is the beginning of the lemon plant's life cycle. It contains the embryo of the plant and has the potential to grow into a mature lemon tree.
2. Seedling: The seedling stage is when the seed germinates and the first leaves and roots emerge. This stage is critical for the development of the plant.
3. Sapling: The sapling stage is when the seedling grows into a small tree with a well-developed root system and a strong stem.
4. Adult: The adult stage is when the lemon tree reaches its full maturity and produces fruit.
5. Dead: The dead stage is when the lemon tree has reached the end of its life cycle and has stopped growing.
