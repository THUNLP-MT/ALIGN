INFO - Agent Action: look at baby beaver
look at baby ant

Reasoning: To find the animal with the longest life span, I need to compare the life spans of the animals present. Elephants generally have a longer life span than beavers and ants, but I should verify the information for beavers and ants as well.

Reasoning: To find the animal with the longest life span, I need to compare the life spans of the animals present.
