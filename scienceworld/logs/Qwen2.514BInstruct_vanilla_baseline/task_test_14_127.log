# Observation from the environment
The wood cup containing red paint is now on the table.
The wood cup containing yellow paint is now on the table.

Your task is to determine which of the two inclined planes (B, H) has the steepest angle. After completing your experiment, focus on the inclined plane with the steepest angle.

Now you need to give your next action. 

Since the environment does not mention inclined planes in the current room, I will assume the planes are in another room. Let's go to the hallway to find them.
