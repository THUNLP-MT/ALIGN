INFO - Agent Action: look at crocodile egg

Based on the information provided, the crocodile egg is likely related to the animal with the longest lifespan. After dealing with the longest lifespan, we will focus on the shortest lifespan, which is likely the baby mouse. 

Now you need to give your next action.

INFO - Agent Action: Based on the information available, the crocodile egg is associated with a longer lifespan compared to the baby mouse. Since the environment does not provide detailed lifespan information, we can infer that the crocodile has a longer lifespan than the mouse.

Now that we have identified the animal with the longest lifespan (the crocodile, represented by the crocodile egg), and the animal with the shortest lifespan (the mouse, represented by the baby mouse), we can conclude the task.

Since the task is completed, no further action is needed. However, if the environment requires a specific action to confirm the task completion, we can:

INFO - Agent Action: task

Since the environment does not accept "look around" and the task is to identify the animals with the longest and shortest life spans, stating the task might help confirm completion. If not accepted, we can simply restate the focus on the identified animals.
