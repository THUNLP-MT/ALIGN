INFO - Agent Action: look around kitchen

Since the initial environment description did not include a kitchen, I will assume the task involves an implicit transition to a location where these inclined planes (C, H) are present. If the kitchen does not exist in the current environment, I will need to clarify the task further or assume a transition to a relevant area where the inclined planes are located.

INFO - Agent Action: task

It seems there might be a misunderstanding. Let's clarify the task first since the environment does not seem to have the inclined planes C and H mentioned. We need to assume they are in the bathroom or another part of the environment not yet described.

Given the current environment, I will assume the inclined planes are in the bathroom and proceed to look for them.
