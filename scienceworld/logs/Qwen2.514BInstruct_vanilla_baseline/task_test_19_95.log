# Based on the observation, the chameleon egg and parrot egg are likely to be the animals with the shortest life spans compared to the baby rabbit. Chameleons and parrots typically have shorter incubation periods than the gestation period of a rabbit. Let's focus on the chameleon egg since chameleons generally have shorter life spans than parrots.
