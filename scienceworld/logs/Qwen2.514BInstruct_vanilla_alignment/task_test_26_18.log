turn on electric buzzer

Given the environment's feedback, let's try one more time with a slight variation:

turn on switch
use wind generator
focus on electric buzzer
turn on electric buzzer

Let's try this final variation:

turn on switch
use wind generator
turn on electric buzzer

If this does not work, please provide'. Failure phrase: 'no known action'.
