INFO - Agent Action: wait1

# Observation from the environment
The brick is slowly moving down the inclined plane B.

Your task is to determine which of the two inclined planes (B, H) has the shallowest angle. After completing your experiment, focus on the inclined plane with the shallowest angle.

Now you need to give your next action. 

# Observation from the environment
The brick has now stopped moving down the inclined plane B.

Your task is to determine which of the two inclined planes (B, H) has the shallowest angle. After completing your experiment, focus on the inclined plane with the shallowest angle.
