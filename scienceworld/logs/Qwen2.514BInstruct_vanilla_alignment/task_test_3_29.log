# Explanation
Since the art studio does not have any new items that are not already present on the table, I decided to return to the kitchen to check if there are any other items that could be useful for creating violet paint. Violet paint can be created by mixing red and blue paint, which are already available in the art studio. However, I need to ensure that I have all the necessary items before proceeding with the mixing.
