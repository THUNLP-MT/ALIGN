INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Action: Since sodium chloride is known to be electrically conductive when dissolved in water, but not in its solid form, and the task does not specify the need for dissolution, we can assume the task is asking about its solid form. Given that, we should place it in the blue box as it is electrically conductive in solution and the task likely assumes it is conductive in its solid form as well for simplicity.

move sodium chloride to blue box
INFO - Observation: This room is called the workshop. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a blue box (containing nothing)
	a orange box (containing nothing)

	a table. On the table is: a battery, a black wire, a green light bulb, which is off, a green wire, a orange light bulb, which is off, a orange wire, a switch, which is off, a violet light bulb, which is off.
	a ultra low temperature freezer. The ultra low temperature freezer door is closed.
