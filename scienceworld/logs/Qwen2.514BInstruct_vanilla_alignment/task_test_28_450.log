INFO - Agent Action: connect black wire to terminal 1 of black wire and unknown substance U terminal 1

# Observation from the environment
It seems there is an ambiguity in specifying the terminals. Let's try a simpler approach to check conductivity.

Your task is to determine if unknown substance U is electrically conductive. The unknown substance U is located around the workshop. First, focus on the unknown substance U. If it is electrically conductive, place it in the red box. If it is electrically nonconductive, place it in the green box.

Now you need to give your next action. 

Since directly connecting the wire to the unknown substance is not working, let's try using the battery to test conductivity.

Your task is to determine if unknown substance U is electrically conductive. The unknown substance U is located around the workshop. First, focus on the unknown substance U. If it is electrically conductive, place it in the red box. If it is electrically nonconductive, place it in the green box.

Now you need to give your next action. 

Since the direct connection approach is not working, let's try placing the unknown substance U directly in the circuit and see if it conducts electricity.
