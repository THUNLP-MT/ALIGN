de/activate switch' did not succeed (Observation: "No known action matches that input.").
Possible Reasons:
- The object 'electric buzzer' might not exist yet, might not be ready (e.g., needs planting, mixing), or you might need to use its exact name. Check the task steps and ensure all prerequisites are met. Ensure you are using the correct name, perhaps ''electric buzzer'' if that is the expected item.
Suggestion: Please check the environment state, your location, ensure the object is ready, and verify you are using the correct name and syntax.
