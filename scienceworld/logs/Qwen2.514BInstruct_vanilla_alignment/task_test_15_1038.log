# Let's check the time taken for the wood block to slide down each surface to determine which has more friction. If the wood block took longer to slide down the aluminum surface, it means the aluminum surface has more friction. If it took longer on the platinum surface, then platinum has more friction. Let's start with the aluminum surface. 

Since the action to directly place the wood block on the inclined plane wasn't working, I will first place it on the table and then move it to the inclined plane.
