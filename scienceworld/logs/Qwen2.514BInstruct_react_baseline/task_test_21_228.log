INFO - Score: 5
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The solid unknown substance U is visible in the room, so I need to pick it up to measure its melting point.
ACTION: pick up solid unknown substance U
INFO - Agent Action: pick up solid unknown substance U
INFO - Observation: You move the solid unknown substance U to the inventory.
INFO - Score: 6
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Now that I have the solid unknown substance U and the thermometer, I need to measure its melting point.
ACTION: use thermometer on solid unknown substance U
INFO - Agent Action: use thermometer on solid unknown substance U
INFO - Observation: the thermometer measures a temperature of 10 degrees celsius
INFO - Score: 7
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The temperature of the solid unknown substance U is 10 degrees celsius, which means it has already melted since the room temperature is 10 degrees celsius. This indicates that its melting point is above -10.0 degrees celsius.
ACTION: focus on orange box
INFO - Agent Action: focus on orange box
INFO - Observation: You focus on the orange box.
INFO - Score: -100
