INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The solid unknown substance Y is now on the stove, I need to monitor its temperature with the thermometer.
ACTION: use thermometer on solid unknown substance Y
INFO - Agent Action: use thermometer on solid unknown substance Y
INFO - Observation: the thermometer measures a temperature of 35 degrees celsius
INFO - Score: 9
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The temperature is still not high enough, I need to continue heating the solid unknown substance Y.
ACTION: wait 5 minutes
INFO - Agent Action: wait 5 minutes
INFO - Observation: No known action matches that input.
INFO - Score: 9
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I need to wait for the substance to heat up further, but the environment does not support a direct wait action. I will check the temperature again after a period by repeating the temperature check action.
