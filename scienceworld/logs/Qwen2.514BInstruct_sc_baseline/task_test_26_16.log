# Observation from the environment
This room is called the foundry. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a blast furnace, which is turned off. The blast furnace door is closed. 
	a sink, which is turned off. In the sink is: nothing.
	a table. On the table is: 
		an electric buzzer (unpowered)
		a wire
		a battery
You also see:
	A door to the outside (that is open)

It seems the environment does not support the "wait" action with a duration. Let's proceed without specifying the duration.

Now you need to give your next action.
