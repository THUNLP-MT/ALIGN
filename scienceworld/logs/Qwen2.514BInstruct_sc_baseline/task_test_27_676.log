Based on the task and the setup, if the green light bulb does not light up, it indicates that sodium chloride is not electrically conductive. If it lights up, sodium chloride is electrically conductive. Since we cannot directly look at the green light bulb, we will proceed based on the assumption that the setup has been correctly followed. If we assume the light did not turn on, we will place the sodium chloride in the blue box.
