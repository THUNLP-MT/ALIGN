# Based on common knowledge, the crocodile egg, baby mouse, and baby wolf are the animals present. Among these, the crocodile egg has the shortest lifespan in the hatching stage. However, since the axe is not an animal, I will compare the known lifespans:

- Crocodile eggs hatch in about 65-80 days.
- Mice have a lifespan of around 2-3 years.
- Wolves have a lifespan of around 6-8 years.

Given this, the crocodile egg is the animal with the shortest life span in this context. 

Since no further action is needed to identify the animal with the shortest life span, the task is complete. 

Task completion: The animal with the shortest life span is the crocodile egg.
INFO - Observation: No known action matches that input.
