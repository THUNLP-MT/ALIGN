Since the environment does not mention inclined planes C and H, I need to clarify if there's any misunderstanding or if these objects are hidden and need to be revealed through interaction. Let's check the immediate objects for any clues or if they transform into the required objects upon interaction. If not, I will need further instructions or a reevaluation of the task details.
