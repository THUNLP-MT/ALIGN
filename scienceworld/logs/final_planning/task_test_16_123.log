INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the door to the outside. Then, I will pick up unknown material C and take it to the foundry's table. Next, I will pick up unknown material D and take it to the foundry's table. After that, I will put unknown material C on the table and use it to create an inclined plane. Then, I will put unknown material D on the table and use it to create another inclined plane. Finally, I will focus on the inclined plane with the least friction.
