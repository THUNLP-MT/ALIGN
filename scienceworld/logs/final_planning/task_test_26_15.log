You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will focus on the electric motor. Then, I will pick up the battery. Next, I will pick up the red wire. After that, I will connect the red wire to the positive terminal of the battery. Then, I will pick up the red light bulb. Next, I will connect the red light bulb to the other end of the red wire. After that, I will connect the other end of the red light bulb to the electric motor. Finally, I will turn on the switch to power the electric motor.
INFO - Agent Action: focus on electric motor
