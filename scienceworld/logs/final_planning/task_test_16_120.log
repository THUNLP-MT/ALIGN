INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the hallway to find the inclined planes. Then, I will pick up unknown material D and put it on one inclined plane. Next, I will pick up unknown material H and put it on the other inclined plane. After that, I will use a book to slide down unknown material D and observe the motion. Then, I will use the book to slide down unknown material H and compare the motions. Finally, I will focus on the inclined plane with the most friction.
