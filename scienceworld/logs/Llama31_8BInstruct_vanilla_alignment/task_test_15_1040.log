[Environment Feedback]: Your action 'focus on inclined plane with the most friction' did not succeed (Observation: "No known action matches that input.").
Possible Reasons:
- The object 'inclined plane with the most friction' might not exist yet, might not be ready (e.g., needs planting, mixing), or you might need to use its exact name. Check the task steps and ensure all prerequisites are met. Ensure you are using the correct name, perhaps ''inclined plane with the most friction'' if that is the expected item.
Suggestion: Please check the environment state, your location, ensure the object is ready, and verify you are using the correct name and syntax.

[Environment Feedback]: Your action 'focus on platinum inclined plane' did not succeed (Observation: "No known action matches that input.").
Possible Reasons:

Suggestion: Please check the environment state, your location, ensure the object is ready, and verify you are using the correct name and syntax.
