[Environment Feedback]: Your action 'go to flower pot 3 from the current location' uses an invalid command format.
Reason: The 'go to' action only accepts the destination location name (e.g., 'go to flower pot 3' or 'go to hallway'). Specifying the source location using 'from the current location' is not supported.
Suggestion: Please use 'look around' to see valid exits from your current location (the greenhouse) and then use 'go to [valid exit]'.
INFO - Score: 18
INFO - Done: False
INFO - Log contents when executing `WrapStep`: WARNING - Intercepted invalid 'go to ... from ...' syntax: 'go to flower pot 3 from the current location'.
