INFO - ========== Task Name: inclined-plane-friction-named-surfaces | Task ID: 15-1042 ==========
INFO - Task: This room is called the bathroom. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a bathtub, which is turned off. In the bathtub is: nothing.

INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the kitchen to look for the inclined planes made of aluminum and zinc, then I will pick up the inclined planes and move them to the bathroom or a suitable location, next I will find or create a way to measure friction, such as using the glass cup and water from the toilet to create a simple experiment, after that I will set up the experiment by placing each inclined plane at the same angle and using the same object to test the friction, then I will use the glass cup filled with water to test the friction on each plane by measuring the time it takes for the cup to slide down or the force required to move it, subsequently I will compare the results to determine which inclined plane has the most friction, and finally I will focus on the inclined plane with the most friction to complete the task.
