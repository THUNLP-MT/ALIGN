You also see:

	A door to the greenhouse (that is open)
	A door to the kitchen (that is open)
	A door to the living room (that is open)
	A door to the workshop (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the greenhouse to find the unknown D plant, then I will look at the plant to determine its seed shape, after that I will use my knowledge of genetics to determine if the spherical seed shape is dominant or recessive, next I will go to the location where the green and blue boxes are, and finally I will focus on the green box if the trait is dominant or the blue box if the trait is recessive.

INFO - Agent Action: look at the seed jar
INFO - Observation: a seed jar (containing a ovate unknown D seed, a spherical unknown D seed)
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Action: Since the seed jar contains both an ovate and a spherical seed, this suggests that the unknown D plant is likely heterozygous for the seed shape trait. Given this information, the next action would be to use knowledge of genetics to infer the dominance relationship. However, the environment does not provide explicit genetic information, so the next logical step based on the task's instructions and the information given would be to proceed under the assumption that the presence of both seed types gives a clue about dominance. 

focus on the green box

INFO - Score: 17

INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Action: focus on the green box should be a valid action according to the task description, but since it's not recognized, I'll try a slightly different formulation:

use green box
INFO - Observation: No known action matches that input.
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Action: The correct action should directly reference the "focus on" command as mentioned in the task description. Let's try again with the precise wording:

focus on green box
INFO - Observation: No known action matches that input.
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Action: Given the task's specific instruction to "focus on the green box" if the trait is dominant, and the environment not recognizing this command, let's try to use the exact wording of the action as described in the task:

focus on OBJ is the format, so the correct action should be:

focus on the green box 

However, since this is not recognized, the task description implies that "focus on OBJ" is a valid action format. Thus, the correct action, following the format to the letter, should be:

focus on green box 

But since this also doesn't work, let's consider the action format again and try:

focus on the blue box
INFO - Observation: No known action matches that input.
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Action: Given the format for actions, it seems like the environment requires a specific syntax. The action "focus on OBJ" is mentioned in the instructions, so let's try again with the correct object, using the exact format:

focus on green box

If this doesn't work, the issue might be with how the action is being interpreted. Since "focus on" is the action and "green box" or "blue box" is the object, let's ensure we're using the correct syntax as per the environment's rules. However, considering the provided rules and the task's description, the action should be straightforward. Let's consider an alternative approach that directly addresses the task without assuming the "focus on" action's specifics:

Given the presence of both ovate and spherical seeds, and without explicit genetic information, the task implies a decision based on observed traits. The critical step here is determining dominance or recessiveness based on the seeds' shapes. However, the environment doesn't provide a direct way to
