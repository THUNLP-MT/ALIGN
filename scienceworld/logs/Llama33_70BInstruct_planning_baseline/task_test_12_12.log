INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Action: focus on OBJ is not a valid action, I should recall that the life stages of a butterfly are: egg, larva, pupa, and adult.

focus on the 4 life stages of the butterfly is not an action, I should use the correct format: 

focus on OBJ 

In this case, OBJ should be the life stages of the butterfly, so I will try:

focus on egg, larva, pupa, and adult 

However, this is still not a valid action.

Let me try again:

Since the action "focus on" requires an object, I will try to use it with the object being the life stages of the butterfly, but in the correct format:

focus on egg 

Then, I will do the same for the other stages:

focus on larva 
focus on pupa 
focus on adult 

But first, I need to focus on egg.

I will use the action "focus on OBJ" with a different object, but first, I need to find an object that is related to the life stages of a butterfly.
