INFO - ========== Task Name: inclined-plane-friction-unnamed-surfaces | Task ID: 16-120 ==========
INFO - Task: This room is called the greenhouse. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a bee hive. The bee hive door is closed. 
	a jug (containing nothing)
	a sink, which is turned off. In the sink is: nothing.
You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
	A door to the outside (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the hallway to look for the inclined planes made of unknown materials D and H. Then, I will pick up the inclined planes and bring them back to the greenhouse. Next, I will look around to find suitable objects to use for the experiment, such as the jug or other items that can be used to test friction. After that, I will use the objects to conduct an experiment to compare the friction of the two inclined planes, possibly by placing them at the same angle and using the same object to slide down each plane. Once I have completed the experiment, I will determine which inclined plane has the most friction. Finally, I will focus on the inclined plane with the most friction to complete the task.
