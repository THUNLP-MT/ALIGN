INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will look around to locate the solid unknown substance U and the thermometer, then I will focus on the thermometer to note its current reading, next I will focus on the solid unknown substance U, after that I will use the thermometer to measure the melting point of the solid unknown substance U by possibly using the oven or stove to heat it, once I have the melting point I will compare it to -10.0 degrees celsius, if it's above I will focus on the orange box, and if it's below I will focus on the yellow box.
