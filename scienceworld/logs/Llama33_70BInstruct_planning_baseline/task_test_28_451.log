INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the workshop to locate the unknown substance U, then I will pick up the substance U and bring it back to the kitchen, next I will connect a conductive testing device to the substance U, after that I will activate the testing device to determine if the substance U is electrically conductive, if it is conductive, I will move the substance U to the green box, otherwise I will move it to the blue box, but since the green and blue boxes are not mentioned in the current room, I will first have to look around the workshop and the other connected rooms to find these boxes.
