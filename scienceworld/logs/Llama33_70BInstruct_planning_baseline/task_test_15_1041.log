INFO - ========== Task Name: inclined-plane-friction-named-surfaces | Task ID: 15-1041 ==========
INFO - Task: This room is called the bedroom. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a bed. On the bed is: a mattress. On the mattress is: a white pillow..
	a closet. The closet door is closed. 
	a drawing
	a table. On the table is: nothing.
You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the hallway to explore and potentially find the inclined planes, then I will look around the hallway to identify the locations of the aluminum and zinc inclined planes, next I will pick up the inclined planes and move them to a suitable location for experimentation, after that I will use the inclined planes to conduct a friction experiment, such as releasing an object down each plane and observing which one allows the object to travel farther or faster, subsequently I will compare the results of the experiment to determine which inclined plane has the least friction, and finally I will focus on the inclined plane with the least friction to complete the task.
INFO - Agent Action: look around
