INFO - ========== Task Name: inclined-plane-friction-unnamed-surfaces | Task ID: 16-122 ==========
INFO - Task: This room is called the bedroom. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a bed. On the bed is: a mattress. On the mattress is: a white pillow..
	a book shelf (containing nothing)
	a closet. The closet door is closed. 
	a picture
	a table. On the table is: nothing.
You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the hallway to explore and potentially find the inclined planes, then I will look around the hallway to identify the locations of the inclined planes made of unknown materials D and H, next I will pick up or move the objects that will be used to test friction on each plane, after that I will use the objects to test the friction on each inclined plane, subsequently I will compare the results to determine which plane has the most friction, and finally I will focus on the inclined plane with the most friction to complete the task.
INFO - Agent Action: look around

INFO - Observation: You move the brick to the inclined plane.
INFO - Score: 15
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Action: move brick to inclined plane with unknown material H surface
INFO - Observation: You move the brick to the inclined plane.
INFO - Score: 20
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Action: look at inclined plane with unknown material D surface
INFO - Observation: an inclined plane with a unknown material D surface
INFO - Score: 20
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Action: look at inclined plane with unknown material H surface
INFO - Observation: an inclined plane with a unknown material H surface, with: a brick approximately 1% down the plane
INFO - Score: 20
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Action: look at inclined plane with unknown material D surface
INFO - Observation: an inclined plane with a unknown material D surface
INFO - Score: 20
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Action: look at brick on inclined plane with unknown material D surface
INFO - Observation: No known action matches that input.
INFO - Score: 20
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Action: look at inclined plane with unknown material D surface, with brick
INFO - Observation: No known action matches that input.
INFO - Score: 20
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Action: look in inclined plane with unknown material D surface
INFO - Observation: Inside the inclined plane is: 
	nothing
INFO - Score: 20
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Action: look at brick
INFO - Observation: a brick
INFO - Score: 20

INFO - Agent Action: look at inclined plane with unknown material D surface
INFO - Observation: an inclined plane with a unknown material D surface
INFO - Score: 20
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Action: Since the brick moved 1% down the inclined plane with unknown material H surface, but there is no information about the brick moving down the inclined plane with unknown material D surface, it can be inferred that the inclined plane with unknown material D surface has more friction.
