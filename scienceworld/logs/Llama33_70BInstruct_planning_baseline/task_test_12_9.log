I. On Variation under Domestication, and on the Principles of Selection.
An individual organism placed under new conditions sometimes varies in a small degree and in very trifling respects such as stature, fatness, sometimes colour, health, habits in animals and probably disposition. Also habits of life develop certain parts. Disuse atrophies.
When the individual is multiplied for long periods by buds the variation is yet small, though greater and occasionally a single bud or individual departs widely from its type and continues steadily to propagate, by buds, such new kind.

INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Action: focus on OBJ is not the correct action, I should have used the correct syntax: focus on giant tortoise, however since I already focused on the egg, my next action should be to think about the life stages, but since I can only give one action, I will try to recall the life stages of the giant tortoise: 
The 4 life stages of the giant tortoise are: 
1. Egg 
2. Hatchling 
3. Juvenile 
4. Adult 

Since I already focused on the egg, my next action is not needed as I already completed the task, however I will give the next action as: 
look around
