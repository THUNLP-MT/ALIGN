INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the kitchen to look for a recipe and ingredients for creating rust. Then, I will identify the necessary ingredients, likely including iron and oxygen, and gather them. Next, I will bring the ingredients back to the foundry and use the blast furnace or other equipment to combine them, possibly using heat and oxygen to facilitate the chemical reaction. After that, I will wait for the reaction to complete and rust to form. Finally, I will focus on the rust once it has been successfully created.
