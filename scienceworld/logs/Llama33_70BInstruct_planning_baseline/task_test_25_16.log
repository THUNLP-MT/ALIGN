INFO - Task: This outside location is called the outside. Here you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	an axe
	a fire pit (containing nothing)
	a fountain (containing nothing)
	the ground
	a shovel
	a substance called wood
You also see:
	A door to the foundry (that is open)
	A door to the greenhouse (that is open)
	A door to the kitchen (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the kitchen to look for the electric buzzer and other necessary electrical components. Then, I will look around the kitchen to find a power source, such as a battery or a generator, and other items like wires or connectors. Next, I will pick up the necessary items, including the electric buzzer, power source, and wires, and move them to a suitable location, possibly the foundry or outside. After that, I will use the items to create an electrical circuit by connecting the power source to the electric buzzer using the wires. Finally, I will activate the power source to turn on the electric buzzer.
