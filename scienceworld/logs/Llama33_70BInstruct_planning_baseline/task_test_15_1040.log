INFO - ========== Task Name: inclined-plane-friction-named-surfaces | Task ID: 15-1040 ==========
INFO - Task: This room is called the foundry. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a blast furnace, which is turned off. The blast furnace door is closed. 
	a sink, which is turned off. In the sink is: nothing.
	a table. On the table is: nothing.
You also see:
	A door to the outside (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to a location where the inclined planes are likely to be, such as a laboratory or a storage room, by going through the open outside door. Then, I will look around to find the aluminum and platinum inclined planes. Next, I will pick up the inclined planes and move them to the table in the foundry. After that, I will use an object, such as a block or a weight, to test the friction on each inclined plane by placing it on each plane and measuring or observing how easily it slides down. I will then compare the results to determine which inclined plane has the most friction. Finally, I will focus on the inclined plane with the most friction to complete the task.
