INFO - ========== Task Name: inclined-plane-friction-unnamed-surfaces | Task ID: 16-124 ==========
INFO - Task: This room is called the greenhouse. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a bee hive. The bee hive door is closed. 
	a jug (containing nothing)
	a sink, which is turned off. In the sink is: nothing.
You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
	A door to the outside (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the hallway to look for the inclined planes made of unknown materials C and D. Then, I will pick up the inclined planes and bring them back to the greenhouse. Next, I will look around to find suitable objects to use for the experiment, such as the jug or other items. After that, I will use the objects to create a test to determine the friction of each inclined plane, possibly by using the jug to pour a substance down the planes or using the bee hive to create a surface for testing. Once the experiment is set up, I will use the objects to conduct the test, observing and recording the results to determine which plane has the most friction. Finally, I will focus on the inclined plane with the most friction to complete the task.
