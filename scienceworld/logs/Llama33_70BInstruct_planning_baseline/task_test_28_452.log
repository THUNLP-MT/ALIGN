	a desk. On the desk is: a drawer.
	a drawing
You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the workshop to locate the unknown substance U, then I will focus on the unknown substance U to determine its electrical conductivity, next I will use an appropriate method to test its conductivity, after that I will either place it in the blue box if it's conductive or the orange box if it's nonconductive, and finally I will verify the placement to ensure the task is completed.
