INFO - ========== Task Name: power-component | Task ID: 25-17 ==========
INFO - Task: This outside location is called the outside. Here you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	an axe
	a fire pit (containing nothing)
	a fountain (containing nothing)
	the ground
	a substance called wood
You also see:
	A door to the foundry (that is open)
	A door to the greenhouse (that is open)
	A door to the kitchen (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the kitchen to look for the electric buzzer and other necessary electrical components. Then, I will look around the kitchen to find a power source, such as a battery or a generator, and other items like wires or connectors. Next, I will focus on the electric buzzer to identify its specific requirements for activation. After that, I will use the available components to create an electrical circuit that powers the buzzer on, which may involve connecting the buzzer to the power source using wires or other connectors. If necessary, I will also activate the power source, such as turning on a generator or flipping a switch. Finally, I will use the electric buzzer to verify that it is working correctly.
