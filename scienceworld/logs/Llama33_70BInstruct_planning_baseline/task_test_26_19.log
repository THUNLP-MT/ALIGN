Since the electric buzzer is already connected to the nuclear generator, and the nuclear generator is on, I will try to use the electric buzzer.

However, the "use" action is not working for the electric buzzer. I will try to think of a different way to interact with the electric buzzer.

One possible approach is to try to activate the electric buzzer, but the "activate" action is not working.

At this point, I'm not sure what else to try. I will try to think of a different approach.

Wait, I have an idea. What if I try to use the nuclear generator to power the electric buzzer? I will try to use the nuclear generator.
