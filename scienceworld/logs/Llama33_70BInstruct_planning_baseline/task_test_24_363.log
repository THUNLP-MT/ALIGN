	A door to the kitchen (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the kitchen to explore and gather information, then I will look for any relevant objects, notes, or books that might provide details about the D plant and its traits, after that I will read any relevant information found to understand the genetic properties of the D plant, next I will determine whether the spherical seed shape is a dominant or recessive trait based on the information gathered, and finally, I will focus on either the red box if the trait is dominant or the green box if it is recessive.
INFO - Agent Action: look around

INFO - Agent Action: look at the seed jar
INFO - Observation: a seed jar (containing a ovate unknown D seed, a spherical unknown D seed)
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Action: Since the seed jar contains both an ovate and a spherical seed, and assuming that the presence of both shapes indicates that the spherical shape is dominant (as it is often the case in genetics that dominant traits are expressed alongside recessive ones), I will focus on the red box.

focus on the red box
