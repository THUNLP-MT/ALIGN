INFO - ========== Task Name: mendelian-genetics-unknown-plant | Task ID: 24-361 ==========
INFO - Task: This room is called the art studio. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a large cupboard. The large cupboard door is closed. 
	a table. On the table is: a jug (containing nothing).
	a wood cup (containing blue paint)
	a wood cup (containing yellow paint)
	a wood cup (containing red paint)
You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will look around the art studio to see if there are any clues or objects that can help me determine the dominant or recessive trait of the spherical seed shape in the unknown D plant. Then, I will check the large cupboard and the table to see if there are any notes, books, or other objects that can provide information about the task. Next, I will go to the hallway to explore other rooms and find any relevant information about the D plant and its traits. After that, I will search for the green box and the blue box to understand what they represent in the context of the task. Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will analyze it to determine whether the spherical seed shape is a dominant or recessive trait and focus on the corresponding box.
