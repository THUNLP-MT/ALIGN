INFO - ========== Task Name: inclined-plane-friction-unnamed-surfaces | Task ID: 16-123 ==========
INFO - Task: This room is called the foundry. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a blast furnace, which is turned off. The blast furnace door is closed. 
	a sink, which is turned off. In the sink is: nothing.
	a table. On the table is: nothing.
You also see:
	A door to the outside (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to a location where the inclined planes are, as they are not in the foundry. Then, I will pick up the inclined planes made of unknown materials C and D. Next, I will place them on the table in the foundry. After that, I will find objects to use on the inclined planes to test friction, possibly using the sink to wet objects if needed. I will then use these objects to test the friction on each inclined plane by placing them on the planes and observing how easily they slide down. I will compare the results to determine which inclined plane has the least friction. Finally, I will focus on the inclined plane with the least friction to complete the task.

INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Action: Since the wood block on the inclined plane with unknown material D surface is approximately 17% down the plane, and there is no wood block on the inclined plane with unknown material C surface, or at least no information about its position, we can assume the wood block on the inclined plane with unknown material C surface didn't move or moved very little, which would indicate that the inclined plane with unknown material C surface has more friction than the inclined plane with unknown material D surface.
