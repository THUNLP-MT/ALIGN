INFO - ========== Task Name: test-conductivity | Task ID: 27-679 ==========
INFO - Task: This room is called the living room. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a chair. On the chair is: nothing.
	a couch. On the couch is: a white pillow.
	a desk. On the desk is: a drawer.
	a painting
You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the hallway and then proceed to the workshop to locate the sodium chloride. Then, I will focus on the sodium chloride to determine its electrical conductivity. Next, I will use a device to test the electrical conductivity of the sodium chloride. After that, I will pick up the sodium chloride and move to the location of the yellow and purple boxes. Finally, I will place the sodium chloride in the yellow box if it is electrically conductive or in the purple box if it is electrically nonconductive.
