INFO - ========== Task Name: inclined-plane-friction-named-surfaces | Task ID: 15-1039 ==========
INFO - Task: This room is called the workshop. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	an inclined plane with a aluminum surface
	an inclined plane with a platinum surface
	a steel block
	a stopwatch, which is deactivated. 
	a table. On the table is: a battery, a blue light bulb, which is off, a blue wire, a green light bulb, which is off, a green wire, a switch, which is off, a violet light bulb, which is off, a yellow wire.
	a ultra low temperature freezer. The ultra low temperature freezer door is closed. 
You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will pick up the steel block and place it on each inclined plane to prepare for the experiment. Then, I will use the stopwatch to measure the time it takes for the steel block to slide down each inclined plane. Next, I will compare the times to determine which inclined plane has the least friction. After completing the experiment, I will focus on the inclined plane with the least friction to signal the completion of the task.
INFO - Agent Action: look around
