You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will focus on the electric motor, then I will pick up the battery, followed by picking up the black wire and the red wire, next I will connect one end of the black wire to the battery and the other end to the electric motor, after that I will connect one end of the red wire to the battery and the other end to the electric motor, and finally I will activate the electric motor to turn it on using the battery as the nonrenewable power source.
INFO - Agent Action: focus on electric motor
INFO - Observation: You focus on the electric motor.
