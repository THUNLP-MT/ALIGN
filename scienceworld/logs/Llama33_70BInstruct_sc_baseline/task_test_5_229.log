INFO - Agent Action: Since the task is to move the adult bee to the green box, and the previous actions were not successful, let's try to think outside the box. 
The adult bee is already in the inventory, so we can try to drop it or put it down. 
However, the "put down" action is not valid. 
Let's try to use the "move" action in a different way. 
We can try to move the adult bee to the table or the bed, but it's not clear if that would be a valid action. 
Another option is to try to open the closet door, but that's not directly related to the task. 
At this point, it's not clear what the correct action is, so let's try to look around again and see if we can find any other clues or objects that might help us.
