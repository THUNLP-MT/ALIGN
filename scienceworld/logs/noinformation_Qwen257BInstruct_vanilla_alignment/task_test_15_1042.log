Possible Reasons:
- The object 'aluminum plane' might not exist yet, might not be ready (e.g., needs planting, mixing), or you might need to use its exact name. For tasks requiring focus based on a property (like ''inclined plane with the most friction''), ensure you have identified the correct specific item that has that property and are using its exact name.
Suggestion: Please check the environment state, your location, ensure the object is ready, and verify you are using the correct name and syntax.
