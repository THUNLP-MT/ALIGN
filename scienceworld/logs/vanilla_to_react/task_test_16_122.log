ACTION: look at inclined plane with unknown material D
INFO - Agent Action: look at inclined plane with unknown material D
INFO - Observation: This room is called the workshop. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a brick
	an inclined plane with a unknown material D surface
	an inclined plane with a unknown material H surface
	a stopwatch, which is deactivated. 
	a table. On the table is: a battery, a blue light bulb, which is off, a blue wire, a green light bulb, which is off, a orange wire, a red wire, a switch, which is off, a violet light bulb, which is off.
	a ultra low temperature freezer. The ultra low temperature freezer door is closed. 
You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)

[Environment Feedback]: Your action 'look at inclined plane with unknown material D' did not succeed as expected in the workshop (Observation: "No known action matches that input.").
Reason: This could be due to an incorrect command, a non-existent or inaccessible object, or the action not being applicable in the current situation.
Suggestion: Please check the command syntax, object names, your location, and the environment state.

Possible Reasons:
- The object 'inclined plane with unknown material d' might not exist yet, might not be ready (e.g., needs planting, mixing), or you might need to use its exact name. For tasks requiring focus based on a property (like ''inclined plane with the most friction''), ensure you have identified the correct specific item that has that property and are using its exact name.
Suggestion: Please check the environment state, your location, ensure the object is ready, and verify you are using the correct name and syntax.
