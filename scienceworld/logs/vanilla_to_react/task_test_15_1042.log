[Environment Feedback]: Your action 'go to outside' failed (Observation: "No known action matches that input.").
Reason: You cannot go directly to 'outside' from your current location (the hallway). Movement is only possible between directly connected locations.
Suggestion: Use 'look around' to see the available exits and connected locations from here.
INFO - Score: 5
INFO - Done: False
INFO - Log contents when executing `WrapStep`: WARNING - Detected potential failure phrase 'no known action' in observation string for standard action 'go to outside'.
WARNING - Handling failure based on observation content for standard action 'go to outside'. Failure phrase: 'no known action'.
INFO - Detected failed 'go to outside' action, likely due to non-adjacency from the hallway.

ACTION: focus on inclined plane with a aluminum surface
INFO - Agent Action: focus on inclined plane with a aluminum surface
INFO - Observation: You focus on the inclined plane with a aluminum surface.

[Environment Note]: The task finished after focusing on 'inclined plane with a aluminum surface', but the score (-100) indicates potential issues. Ensure all necessary steps and conditions were met before using the 'focus on' command.
INFO - Score: -100
INFO - Done: True
INFO - Log contents when executing `WrapStep`: INFO - Conceptual focus task detected. Allowing action 'focus on inclined plane with a aluminum surface' targeting specific instance 'inclined plane with a aluminum surface' to proceed, bypassing literal match check against ''inclined plane with the most friction''.
WARNING - Focus action 'focus on inclined plane with a aluminum surface' resulted in task completion with score -100. Prerequisites might have been missed.
