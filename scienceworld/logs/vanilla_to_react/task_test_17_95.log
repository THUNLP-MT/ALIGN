[Environment Feedback]: Your action 'go to outside from kitchen' uses an invalid command format.
Reason: The 'go to' action only accepts the destination location name (e.g., 'go to outside' or 'go to hallway'). Specifying the source location using 'from kitchen' is not supported.
Suggestion: Please use 'look around' to see valid exits from your current location (the kitchen) and then use 'go to [valid exit]'.
