INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I need to conduct the experiment with the inclined planes to determine which has the least friction.
ACTION: focus on inclined plane with a zinc surface
INFO - Agent Action: focus on inclined plane with a zinc surface
INFO - Observation: You focus on the inclined plane with a zinc surface.

[Environment Note]: The task finished after focusing on 'inclined plane with a zinc surface', but the score (-100) indicates potential issues. Ensure all necessary steps and conditions were met before using the 'focus on' command.
INFO - Score: -100
INFO - Done: True
INFO - Log contents when executing `WrapStep`: INFO - Conceptual focus task detected. Allowing action 'focus on inclined plane with a zinc surface' targeting specific instance 'inclined plane with a zinc surface' to proceed, bypassing literal match check against ''inclined plane with the least friction''.
WARNING - Focus action 'focus on inclined plane with a zinc surface' resulted in task completion with score -100. Prerequisites might have been missed.
