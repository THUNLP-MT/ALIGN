INFO - Task: This room is called the foundry. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a blast furnace, which is turned off. The blast furnace door is closed. 
	a sink, which is turned off. In the sink is: nothing.
	a table. On the table is: nothing.
You also see:
	A door to the outside (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the outside to find the kitchen. Then, I will look around the kitchen to find the recipe and ingredients needed to create rust. Next, I will go back to the foundry and pick up the necessary ingredients. After that, I will use a container to mix the ingredients together in the correct proportions. Then, I will use the mixed substance on the blast furnace to create rust. Finally, I will focus on the rust.
