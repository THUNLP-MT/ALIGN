Next, I will pick up the wood cup containing yellow paint and move it to the table. After that, I will pick up the wood cup containing red paint and move it to the table. Then, I will use the red paint in the wood cup on the glass cup in the large cupboard to create a mixture. Next, I will use the yellow paint in the wood cup on the mixture in the glass cup to create a secondary color (orange). Then, I will focus on the orange paint. After that, I will pick up the wood cup containing blue paint and move it to the table. Next, I will use the blue paint in the wood cup on the orange paint in the glass cup to create violet-red paint. Finally, I will focus on the violet-red paint.
