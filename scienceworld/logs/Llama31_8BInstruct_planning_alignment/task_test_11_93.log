INFO - ========== Task Name: grow-plant | Task ID: 11-93 ==========
INFO - Task: This room is called the greenhouse. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a bee hive. The bee hive door is closed. 
	a flower pot 1 (containing soil)
	a flower pot 2 (containing soil)
	a flower pot 3 (containing soil)
	a jug (containing nothing)
	a sink, which is turned off. In the sink is: nothing.
You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
	A door to the outside (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will focus on a seed. Then, I will go to the bathroom to pick up the seed. Next, I will go to the hallway and then to the bathroom to pick up a flower pot. After that, I will go back to the greenhouse and use the flower pot to mix with the soil from one of the flower pots. Then, I will use the jug to pour water into the mixed soil. Next, I will use the thermometer on the mixed soil to measure its temperature. After that, I will use the thermometer on the mixed soil again to check if the temperature is suitable for planting. If it is, I will use the seed on the mixed soil to plant it. Then, I will use the sink to pour water into the soil to keep it moist. Next, I will use the sink to pour water into the soil again to keep it moist. After that, I will wait for the seed to grow into a seedling. Once it has reached the seedling stage, I will use the sink to pour water into the soil again to keep it moist. Then, I will wait for the seedling to grow into a mature plant. Once it has reached the reproduction life stage, I will use the sink to pour water into the soil one last time to keep it moist.
