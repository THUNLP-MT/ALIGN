INFO - ========== Task Name: inclined-plane-determine-angle | Task ID: 14-129 ==========
INFO - Task: This room is called the foundry. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a blast furnace, which is turned off. The blast furnace door is closed. 
	a sink, which is turned off. In the sink is: nothing.
	a table. On the table is: nothing.
You also see:
	A door to the outside (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the table. Then, I will look at the table to see if there are any inclined planes on it. Next, I will pick up the inclined planes (C and H) if they are on the table. After that, I will go to the blast furnace and use the protractor on each inclined plane to measure their angles. Then, I will compare the angles to determine which inclined plane has the steepest angle. Finally, I will focus on the inclined plane with the steepest angle.
INFO - Agent Action: go to the table.
