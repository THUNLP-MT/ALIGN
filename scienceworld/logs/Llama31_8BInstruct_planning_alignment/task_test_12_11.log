INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the hallway. Then, I will look around to find a parrot. Next, I will pick up the parrot and move it to the kitchen. After that, I will use the thermometer on the parrot to measure its temperature. However, since the task is about the life stages of a parrot, I will need to find a parrot's life stages information. I will then use the information to determine the four life stages of the parrot.
