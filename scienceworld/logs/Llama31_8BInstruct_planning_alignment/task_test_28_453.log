INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the workshop to locate the unknown substance U. Then, I will pick up the unknown substance U. Next, I will use a multimeter to test if the unknown substance U is electrically conductive. If it is conductive, I will move the unknown substance U to the orange box. If it is nonconductive, I will move the unknown substance U to the yellow box.
