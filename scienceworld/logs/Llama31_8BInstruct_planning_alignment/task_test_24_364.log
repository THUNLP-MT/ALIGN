INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the greenhouse to obtain seeds from the D plant. Then, I will pick up the seeds and put them in my inventory. Next, I will go to the kitchen to obtain a seed jar and a spoon. Then, I will mix the seeds in the seed jar to create a uniform mixture. After that, I will go to the workshop to obtain a blue box and a green box. Then, I will pour some of the seed mixture into the blue box and the rest into the green box. Next, I will go to the art studio to obtain a paintbrush and some paint, and use the paintbrush to paint the blue box with a recessive symbol and the green box with a dominant symbol. Then, I will go back to the hallway and look at the blue box and the green box to determine which one has the dominant trait.
