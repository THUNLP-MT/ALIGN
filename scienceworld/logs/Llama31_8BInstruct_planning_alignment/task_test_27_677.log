INFO - ========== Task Name: test-conductivity | Task ID: 27-677 ==========
INFO - Task: This room is called the kitchen. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a chair. On the chair is: nothing.
	a counter. On the counter is: a bowl (containing a red apple, a banana, an orange, a potato), a drawer.
	a cupboard. The cupboard door is closed. 
	a freezer. The freezer door is closed. 
	a fridge. The fridge door is closed. 
	a glass jar (containing a substance called sodium chloride)
	a lighter
	a oven, which is turned off. The oven door is closed. 
	a painting
	a sink, which is turned off. In the sink is: nothing.
	a substance called soap
	a stopwatch, which is deactivated. 
	a stove, which is turned off. On the stove is: nothing.
	a table. On the table is: a glass cup (containing nothing).
	a thermometer, currently reading a temperature of 10 degrees celsius
You also see:
	A door to the bathroom (that is open)
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
	A door to the outside (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the workshop to find the sodium chloride. Then, I will use a device to test if the sodium chloride is electrically conductive. If it is conductive, I will connect it to a device to measure its conductivity. If it is nonconductive, I will use a different device to measure its conductivity. After determining its conductivity, I will go back to the kitchen and use the stove to heat the sodium chloride to a high temperature. Then, I will use the stove to create a spark near the sodium chloride to see if it conducts electricity. If it does, I will place it in the blue box; if it doesn't, I will place it in the orange box.
INFO - Agent Action: go to the hallway
