INFO - ========== Task Name: power-component-renewable-vs-nonrenewable-energy | Task ID: 26-18 ==========
INFO - Task: This room is called the hallway. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a drawing
You also see:
	A door to the art studio (that is open)
	A door to the bedroom (that is open)
	A door to the greenhouse (that is open)
	A door to the kitchen (that is open)
	A door to the living room (that is open)
	A door to the workshop (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will focus on the electric buzzer. Then, I will look around to find a renewable power source, such as a solar panel or a wind turbine. Next, I will connect the power source to a battery or a capacitor to store the energy. After that, I will connect the battery or capacitor to the electric buzzer, creating an electrical circuit that powers it on.
INFO - Agent Action: look around
