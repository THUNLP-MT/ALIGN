INFO - Task: This room is called the hallway. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a drawing
You also see:
	A door to the art studio (that is open)

	A door to the greenhouse (that is open)
	A door to the kitchen (that is open)
	A door to the living room (that is open)
	A door to the workshop (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will focus on the electric buzzer. Then, I will look around to find the necessary components to create an electrical circuit. Next, I will move to the workshop to find the required electrical components. After that, I will pick up the necessary components from the workshop. Then, I will move back to the hallway and connect the components to create the electrical circuit. Finally, I will use the completed circuit to turn on the electric buzzer.
