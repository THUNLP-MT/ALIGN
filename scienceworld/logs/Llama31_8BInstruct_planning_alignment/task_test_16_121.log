INFO - ========== Task Name: inclined-plane-friction-unnamed-surfaces | Task ID: 16-121 ==========
INFO - Task: This room is called the bathroom. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a bathtub, which is turned off. In the bathtub is: nothing.
	a finger painting
	a glass cup (containing nothing)
	a sink, which is turned off. In the sink is: nothing.
	a toilet. In the toilet is: A drain, which is open, a substance called water.
You also see:
	A door to the kitchen (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the kitchen to find the inclined planes (unknown material D and unknown material H). Then, I will pick up both inclined planes and move them to the bathroom. Next, I will use a substance (such as water from the toilet) to lubricate one of the inclined planes. Then, I will use a substance (such as water from the toilet) to lubricate the other inclined plane. After that, I will place both inclined planes on the floor and use the glass cup to roll a small object (such as the finger painting) down each inclined plane. By comparing the distances the object travels, I will determine which inclined plane has the least friction. Finally, I will focus on the inclined plane with the least friction.
INFO - Agent Action: go to LOC (kitchen)
