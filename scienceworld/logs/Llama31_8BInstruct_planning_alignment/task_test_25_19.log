INFO - ========== Task Name: power-component | Task ID: 25-19 ==========
INFO - Task: This room is called the greenhouse. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a bee hive. The bee hive door is closed. 
	a jug (containing nothing)
	a shovel
	a sink, which is turned off. In the sink is: nothing.
You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
	A door to the outside (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will focus on the electric buzzer. Then, I will look around to find the necessary components to create an electrical circuit. Next, I will use the shovel to dig up the soil near the sink, then move the soil to the sink to create a makeshift electrical pathway. After that, I will use the jug to pour water from the sink into the soil, creating a conductive path. Finally, I will connect the bee hive to the electric buzzer using the water-soil pathway, and then activate the device to turn it on.
