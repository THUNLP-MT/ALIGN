INFO - ========== Task Name: grow-fruit | Task ID: 10-96 ==========
INFO - Task: This room is called the workshop. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a table. On the table is: a battery, a black wire, a orange light bulb, which is off, a orange wire, a red wire, a switch, which is off, a violet light bulb, which is off, a yellow light bulb, which is off.
	a ultra low temperature freezer. The ultra low temperature freezer door is closed. 
You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the hallway and then to the living room to pick up the seeds. Next, I will go back to the workshop and use the ultra low temperature freezer to store the seeds. After that, I will go to the hallway and then to the greenhouse (which I assume is located in the adjacent room) to plant the seeds and grow the plants. Once the plants are grown, I will go back to the greenhouse and focus on the plants to ensure they are healthy and ready for cross-pollination. After cross-pollination, I will wait for the plants to produce fruit, specifically an orange, and then focus on the grown orange to complete the task.
