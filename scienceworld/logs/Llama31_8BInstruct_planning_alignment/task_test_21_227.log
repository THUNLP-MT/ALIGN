INFO - ========== Task Name: measure-melting-point-unknown-substance | Task ID: 21-227 ==========
INFO - Task: This room is called the bathroom. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a bathtub, which is turned off. In the bathtub is: nothing.

	A door to the kitchen (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the kitchen. Then, I will look around to locate the thermometer. Next, I will pick up the thermometer. After that, I will go to the location of the solid unknown substance Y. Then, I will use the thermometer on the solid unknown substance Y to measure its melting point. Following that, I will read the thermometer to determine the melting point. If the melting point is above 200.0 degrees celsius, I will go to the kitchen and focus on the yellow box. If the melting point is below 200.0 degrees celsius, I will go to the kitchen and focus on the purple box.
INFO - Agent Action: go to LOC (kitchen)
