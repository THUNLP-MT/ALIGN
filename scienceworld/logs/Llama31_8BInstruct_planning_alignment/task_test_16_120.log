INFO - ========== Task Name: inclined-plane-friction-unnamed-surfaces | Task ID: 16-120 ==========
INFO - Task: This room is called the greenhouse. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a bee hive. The bee hive door is closed. 
	a jug (containing nothing)
	a sink, which is turned off. In the sink is: nothing.
You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
	A door to the outside (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the hallway to find the inclined planes. Then, I will pick up the inclined planes and bring them back to the greenhouse. Next, I will place the inclined planes on the floor in the greenhouse and focus on one of them. After that, I will use a substance (such as water or sand) to create a slippery surface on one of the inclined planes. Then, I will use a small object (such as a marble or a ball) to roll down each inclined plane and observe which one the object rolls down more slowly. Finally, I will focus on the inclined plane with the most friction.
