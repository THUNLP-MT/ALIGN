INFO - ========== Task Name: test-conductivity | Task ID: 27-679 ==========
INFO - Task: This room is called the living room. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a chair. On the chair is: nothing.
	a couch. On the couch is: a white pillow.
	a desk. On the desk is: a drawer.
	a painting
You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the workshop to locate the sodium chloride. Then, I will use a multimeter to test if the sodium chloride is electrically conductive. If it is conductive, I will then go to the lab bench and use the multimeter to measure its electrical conductivity. If it is nonconductive, I will then go to the lab bench and use the multimeter to measure its electrical conductivity. After determining its conductivity, I will go to the storage room, pick up the yellow box if it is conductive or the purple box if it is nonconductive, and then move the sodium chloride into the appropriate box.
