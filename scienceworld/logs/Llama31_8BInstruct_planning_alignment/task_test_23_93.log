INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will pick up the seed jar to obtain the round green pea seeds. Then, I will move the round green pea seeds from the seed jar to the green box. Next, I will pick up the seed jar again to obtain the wrinkly green pea seed. Then, I will move the wrinkly green pea seed from the seed jar to the red box. After that, I will close the bee hive door to prevent any interference from the bees. Finally, I will focus on the green box if the round seed shape is recessive, or focus on the red box if the round seed shape is dominant.
