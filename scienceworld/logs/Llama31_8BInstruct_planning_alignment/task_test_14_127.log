INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the hallway. Then, I will look around to identify the two inclined planes (B and H). Next, I will use a protractor or a similar tool to measure the angle of each inclined plane. After that, I will compare the measured angles to determine which one is steeper. Finally, I will focus on the inclined plane with the steepest angle.
INFO - Agent Action: go to LOC (hallway)
INFO - Observation: The action 'go to loc (hallway)' was not recognized. This might be because 'loc (hallway)' is not an adjacent location, the name is misspelled, or the location doesn't exist.
