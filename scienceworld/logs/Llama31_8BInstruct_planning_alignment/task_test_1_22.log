INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will focus on the substance (air) to identify it as the target for changing its state of matter. Then, I will go to the hallway to find a substance called tin. Next, I will pick up the tin and move it to the desk, where I can use a device to change its state of matter. However, since there is no device mentioned, I will need to find a way to change the state of matter of the tin, such as by using a heat source or a container of water.
