INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the kitchen to find the blue and orange boxes. Then, I will look at the blue box to determine if it contains information about the D plant. Next, I will look at the orange box to determine if it contains information about the D plant. After that, I will read the blue box to learn about the dominant trait. Then, I will read the orange box to learn about the recessive trait. If the blue box indicates that the spherical seed shape is dominant, I will focus on the blue box. If the orange box indicates that the spherical seed shape is recessive, I will focus on the orange box.
