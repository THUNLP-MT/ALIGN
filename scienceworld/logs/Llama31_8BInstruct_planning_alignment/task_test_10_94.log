INFO - ========== Task Name: grow-fruit | Task ID: 10-94 ==========
INFO - Task: This room is called the greenhouse. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a bee hive. The bee hive door is closed. 
	a flower pot 1 (containing nothing)
	a flower pot 2 (containing nothing)
	a flower pot 3 (containing nothing)
	a jug (containing nothing)
	a shovel
	a sink, which is turned off. In the sink is: nothing.
	soil
You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
	A door to the outside (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the bathroom to get seeds. Then, I will go back to the greenhouse and use the soil to plant the seeds in one of the flower pots. Next, I will water the soil by pouring water from the jug into the flower pot. After that, I will wait for the seeds to grow into plants. Once the plants are grown, I will focus on them to ensure they are healthy. Then, I will use the shovel to gently remove the flowers from the plants to prevent them from producing seeds, allowing the plants to focus their energy on growing fruit. After that, I will go to the bathroom to get more seeds, which will be used to plant another set of flowers in a different flower pot. Next, I will repeat the process of watering and waiting for the seeds to grow into plants. Once I have multiple sets of plants, I will go to the hallway to get a bee from the bee hive and bring it back to the greenhouse to cross-pollinate the plants. Finally, I will wait for the cross-pollinated plants to grow into a mature orange.
