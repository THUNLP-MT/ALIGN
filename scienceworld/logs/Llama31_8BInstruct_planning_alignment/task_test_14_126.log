INFO - ========== Task Name: inclined-plane-determine-angle | Task ID: 14-126 ==========
INFO - Task: This room is called the living room. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a book shelf (containing A book (Pride and Prejudice) titled Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen, A book (Sherlock Holmes) titled Sherlock Holmes by Arthur Conan Doyle, A book (Sherlock Holmes) titled Sherlock Holmes by Arthur Conan Doyle)
	a chair. On the chair is: nothing.
	a couch. On the couch is: a white pillow.
	a finger painting
	a table. On the table is: nothing.
You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the hallway. Then, I will look around to identify the locations of the inclined planes B and H. Next, I will go to the location of inclined plane B and use a protractor to measure its angle. After that, I will go to the location of inclined plane H and use a protractor to measure its angle. Then, I will compare the two angles to determine which inclined plane has the shallowest angle. Finally, I will focus on the inclined plane with the shallowest angle.
INFO - Agent Action: go to LOC (hallway)
INFO - Observation: The action 'go to loc (hallway)' was not recognized. This might be because 'loc (hallway)' is not an adjacent location, the name is misspelled, or the location doesn't exist. Movement is restricted to adjacent rooms. Use 'look around' to see available exits and verify location names.
