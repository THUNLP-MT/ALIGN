INFO - Task: This room is called the bathroom. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a bathtub, which is turned off. In the bathtub is: nothing.
	a glass cup (containing nothing)
	a painting
	a sink, which is turned off. In the sink is: nothing.
	a toilet. In the toilet is: A drain, which is open, a substance called water.

INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the kitchen to find the inclined planes (aluminum and zinc). Then, I will pick up the aluminum inclined plane and move it to the bathroom. Next, I will pick up the zinc inclined plane and move it to the bathroom. After that, I will place the aluminum inclined plane on the bathtub and measure its angle. Then, I will place the zinc inclined plane on the bathtub and measure its angle. Next, I will use a stopwatch to measure the time it takes for an object to roll down the aluminum inclined plane and the zinc inclined plane. Finally, I will compare the times and focus on the inclined plane with the most friction.
