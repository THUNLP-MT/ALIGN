INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will focus on the electric buzzer. Then, I will go to the kitchen to find the necessary components to create an electrical circuit. Next, I will look around the kitchen to identify the specific objects I need, such as a power source, a conductor, and a switch. After that, I will pick up the power source, conductor, and switch from the kitchen. Then, I will move to the foundry to find a suitable location to create the electrical circuit. Next, I will connect the power source to the conductor, and then connect the conductor to the switch. After that, I will connect the switch to the electric buzzer. Finally, I will activate the switch to turn on the electric buzzer.
