INFO - ========== Task Name: grow-fruit | Task ID: 10-95 ==========
INFO - Task: This room is called the hallway. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a finger painting
You also see:
	A door to the art studio (that is open)
	A door to the bedroom (that is open)
	A door to the greenhouse (that is open)
	A door to the kitchen (that is open)
	A door to the living room (that is open)
	A door to the workshop (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the bathroom to pick up the seeds. Then, I will go to the greenhouse to plant the seeds and grow the plants. Next, I will go to the art studio to pick up the finger painting and use it to create a makeshift greenhouse within the greenhouse to provide a controlled environment for the plants. After that, I will go to the kitchen to pick up a substance to use as fertilizer for the plants. Then, I will go back to the greenhouse to apply the fertilizer to the plants. Next, I will go to the living room to pick up a substance to use as a pest repellent for the plants. Then, I will go back to the greenhouse to apply the pest repellent to the plants. After that, I will wait for the plants to grow and eventually produce flowers. Once the flowers are present, I will go to the workshop to pick up a tool to use as a pollinator to cross-pollinate the flowers. Then, I will go back to the greenhouse to cross-pollinate the flowers. Finally, I will wait for the cross-pollinated flowers to produce a grown orange, which I will then focus on to complete the task.
