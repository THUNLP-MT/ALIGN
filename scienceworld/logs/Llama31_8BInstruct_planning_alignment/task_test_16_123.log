INFO - ========== Task Name: inclined-plane-friction-unnamed-surfaces | Task ID: 16-123 ==========
INFO - Task: This room is called the foundry. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a blast furnace, which is turned off. The blast furnace door is closed. 
	a sink, which is turned off. In the sink is: nothing.
	a table. On the table is: nothing.
You also see:
	A door to the outside (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the table and pick up the inclined plane with unknown material C. Then, I will go to the table and pick up the inclined plane with unknown material D. Next, I will go to the sink and turn it on. After that, I will use a soap dispenser on the soap dispenser to obtain soap, then use the soap on the inclined plane with unknown material C and the inclined plane with unknown material D. Then, I will use a water bottle on the sink to obtain water, and pour the water into the sink. Next, I will use the water in the sink on the inclined plane with unknown material C and the inclined plane with unknown material D. After that, I will use a thermometer on the inclined plane with unknown material C and the inclined plane with unknown material D to measure their temperatures. Then, I will use the inclined plane with unknown material C and the inclined plane with unknown material D to slide a small object down, and measure the distance it travels. Next, I will compare the distances traveled by the object on both inclined planes and determine which one has the least friction. Finally, I will focus on the inclined plane with the least friction.
