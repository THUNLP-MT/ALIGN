INFO - ========== Task Name: test-conductivity | Task ID: 27-675 ==========
INFO - Task: This room is called the workshop. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a green box (containing nothing)
	a red box (containing nothing)
	a red light bulb, which is off
	a substance called sodium chloride
	a table. On the table is: a battery, a black wire, a blue light bulb, which is off, a green light bulb, which is off, a orange light bulb, which is off, a orange wire, a red wire, a switch, which is off.
	a ultra low temperature freezer. The ultra low temperature freezer door is closed. 
You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will focus on the sodium chloride. Then, I will use the red wire on the sodium chloride. Next, I will use the battery on the red wire. After that, I will check if the red light bulb is on. If it is on, I will place the sodium chloride in the red box. If it is not on, I will place the sodium chloride in the green box.
INFO - Agent Action: look around
