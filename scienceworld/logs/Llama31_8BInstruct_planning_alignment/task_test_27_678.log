INFO - ========== Task Name: test-conductivity | Task ID: 27-678 ==========
INFO - Task: This room is called the workshop. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a orange box (containing nothing)
	a red light bulb, which is off
	a substance called sodium chloride
	a table. On the table is: a battery, a black wire, a blue light bulb, which is off, a green light bulb, which is off, a green wire, a orange light bulb, which is off, a orange wire, a switch, which is off.
	a ultra low temperature freezer. The ultra low temperature freezer door is closed. 
	a yellow box (containing nothing)
You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will focus on the sodium chloride. Then, I will connect the green wire to the switch. Next, I will connect the green wire to the sodium chloride. After that, I will turn on the switch. If the sodium chloride conducts electricity, it will light up one of the light bulbs, and I will then place it in the orange box. If not, I will place it in the yellow box.
INFO - Agent Action: focus on sodium chloride
INFO - Observation: You focus on the sodium chloride.
