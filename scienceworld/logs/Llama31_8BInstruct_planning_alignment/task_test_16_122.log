INFO - ========== Task Name: inclined-plane-friction-unnamed-surfaces | Task ID: 16-122 ==========
INFO - Task: This room is called the bedroom. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a bed. On the bed is: a mattress. On the mattress is: a white pillow..
	a book shelf (containing nothing)
	a closet. The closet door is closed. 
	a picture
	a table. On the table is: nothing.
You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the hallway. Then, I will look around to identify the locations of the inclined planes (unknown material D and unknown material H). Next, I will go to the location of unknown material D and pick it up. After that, I will go to the location of unknown material H and pick it up. Then, I will go back to the hallway and set up an experiment to measure the friction of each inclined plane by placing them on the table and using a weight to pull them down the incline. Next, I will measure the force required to pull each inclined plane and compare the results to determine which one has the most friction. Finally, I will focus on the inclined plane with the most friction.
INFO - Agent Action: go to LOC (hallway)
INFO - Observation: The action 'go to loc (hallway)' was not recognized. This might be because 'loc (hallway)' is not an adjacent location, the name is misspelled, or the location doesn't exist. Movement is restricted to adjacent rooms. Use 'look around' to see available exits and verify location names.
