INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the hallway. Then, I will look around to identify the available exits and find the room where the seed jars are located. Next, I will go to that room and look around to find the seed jars. After that, I will pick up the seed jars and examine their contents to determine the shape of the seeds. If the seeds are spherical, I will focus on the red box, indicating that the spherical seed shape is a dominant trait. If the seeds are not spherical, I will focus on the green box, indicating that the spherical seed shape is a recessive trait.
