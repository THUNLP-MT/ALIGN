INFO - Task: This room is called the workshop. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a blue light bulb, which is off
	a electric buzzer, which is off
	a electric motor, which is off
	a nuclear generator, which is off
	a table. On the table is: a battery, a black wire, a green light bulb, which is off, a orange light bulb, which is off, a orange wire, a red light bulb, which is off, a red wire, a switch, which is off.
	a ultra low temperature freezer. The ultra low temperature freezer door is closed. 
	a wind generator, which is off
You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will focus on the electric motor. Then, I will pick up the battery from the table. Next, I will pick up the red wire from the table. After that, I will connect the red wire to the battery. Then, I will pick up the orange wire from the table. Next, I will connect the orange wire to the battery. After that, I will pick up the switch from the table. Then, I will connect the red wire to the switch. Next, I will connect the orange wire to the switch. After that, I will de/activate the switch to turn it on. Finally, I will de/activate the electric motor to turn it on.
