INFO - ========== Task Name: grow-plant | Task ID: 11-96 ==========
INFO - Task: This room is called the workshop. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a table. On the table is: a battery, a black wire, a orange light bulb, which is off, a orange wire, a red wire, a switch, which is off, a violet light bulb, which is off, a yellow light bulb, which is off.
	a ultra low temperature freezer. The ultra low temperature freezer door is closed. 
You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the living room to find a seed. Then, I will pick up the seed. Next, I will go back to the workshop and pick up the ultra low temperature freezer. After that, I will move the seed into the ultra low temperature freezer. Then, I will close the ultra low temperature freezer door. Next, I will wait for a certain duration to simulate the seed germinating. Once the seed has germinated, I will open the ultra low temperature freezer door and pick up the seedling. Then, I will move the seedling to the table in the workshop. Next, I will use the ultra low temperature freezer to simulate a controlled environment for the seedling to grow. After that, I will wait for another duration to simulate the seedling growing into a mature plant. Once the plant has reached the reproduction life stage, I will focus on the plant.
