INFO - ========== Task Name: inclined-plane-friction-unnamed-surfaces | Task ID: 16-124 ==========
INFO - Task: This room is called the greenhouse. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a bee hive. The bee hive door is closed. 
	a jug (containing nothing)
	a sink, which is turned off. In the sink is: nothing.
You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
	A door to the outside (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the hallway to find the inclined planes. Then, I will pick up the inclined planes and bring them back to the greenhouse. Next, I will place the inclined planes on the floor in the greenhouse and pour sand into the jug. Then, I will use the jug to create a ramp under one of the inclined planes. After that, I will use the other inclined plane as a reference and measure the force required to move it down the ramp. Next, I will repeat the process with the other inclined plane and compare the forces. Finally, I will focus on the inclined plane that required the most force to move down the ramp.
