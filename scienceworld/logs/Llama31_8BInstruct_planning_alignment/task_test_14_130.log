INFO - ========== Task Name: inclined-plane-determine-angle | Task ID: 14-130 ==========
INFO - Task: This room is called the bathroom. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a bathtub, which is turned off. In the bathtub is: nothing.

	A door to the kitchen (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the kitchen. Then, I will look around to identify the two inclined planes (C, H). Next, I will use a protractor or a similar tool to measure the angles of both inclined planes. After that, I will compare the measured angles to determine which one is the shallowest. Finally, I will focus on the inclined plane with the shallowest angle.
INFO - Agent Action: go to LOC (the kitchen)
INFO - Observation: The action 'go to loc (the kitchen)' was not recognized. This might be because 'loc (the kitchen)' is not an adjacent location, the name is misspelled, or the location doesn't exist. Movement is restricted to adjacent rooms.
