INFO - Task: This room is called the bedroom. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a bed. On the bed is: a mattress. On the mattress is: a white pillow..
	a closet. The closet door is closed. 
	a drawing
	a table. On the table is: nothing.
You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the hallway. Then, I will look around to find a lab bench or a suitable surface to conduct the experiment. Next, I will pick up the aluminum inclined plane and place it on the surface. After that, I will use a spring scale to measure the force required to move the aluminum plane up the surface. Then, I will repeat the process with the zinc inclined plane. Next, I will compare the forces measured for both planes to determine which one has the least friction. Finally, I will focus on the inclined plane with the least friction.
