INFO - Task: This outside location is called the outside. Here you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	an axe
	a fire pit (containing nothing)
	a fountain (containing nothing)
	the ground
	a shovel
	a substance called wood
You also see:
	A door to the foundry (that is open)
	A door to the greenhouse (that is open)
	A door to the kitchen (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the greenhouse to obtain the necessary materials, specifically the wood and the substance called air. Then, I will go to the foundry to obtain the necessary materials, specifically the substance called wood. Next, I will go to the kitchen to obtain the necessary materials, specifically the substance called wood. After that, I will go to the outside location to mix the wood with the air to create a substance called oxygen. Then, I will go to the foundry to mix the oxygen with the wood to create a substance called carbon dioxide. Next, I will go to the kitchen to mix the carbon dioxide with the wood to create a substance called carbon monoxide. After that, I will go to the outside location to mix the carbon monoxide with the wood to create a substance called cyanide. Then, I will go to the foundry to mix the cyanide with the wood to create a substance called prussiate of potash. Next, I will go to the kitchen to mix the prussiate of potash with the wood to create a substance called potassium ferrocyanide. After that, I will go to the outside location to mix the potassium ferrocyanide with the wood to create a substance called ferric ferrocyanide. Finally, I will mix the ferric ferrocyanide with the wood to create violet paint, and then I will focus on the violet paint.
