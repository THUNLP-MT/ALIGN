INFO - ========== Task Name: grow-plant | Task ID: 11-97 ==========
INFO - Task: This room is called the foundry. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a blast furnace, which is turned off. The blast furnace door is closed. 
	a sink, which is turned off. In the sink is: nothing.
	a table. On the table is: nothing.
You also see:
	A door to the outside (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the living room to find a seed. Then, I will pick up the seed. Next, I will go back to the foundry and use the sink to get water. After that, I will pour the water into a container on the table. Then, I will go to the outside and use the blast furnace to heat the water, creating steam. Next, I will use the steam to mix with the seed on the table, simulating germination. After that, I will wait for the seed to germinate and grow into a seedling. Once the seedling has two leaves, I will use the blast furnace to provide it with heat and light, simulating a greenhouse environment. Then, I will continue to use the blast furnace to provide the necessary conditions for the plant to grow until it reaches the reproduction life stage, at which point it will be able to produce flowers and seeds.
