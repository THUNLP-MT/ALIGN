INFO - ========== Task Name: grow-fruit | Task ID: 10-97 ==========
INFO - Task: This room is called the foundry. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a blast furnace, which is turned off. The blast furnace door is closed. 
	a sink, which is turned off. In the sink is: nothing.
	a table. On the table is: nothing.
You also see:
	A door to the outside (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the living room to get seeds. Then, I will go back to the foundry and use the sink to get water. Next, I will use the water to mix with the air to create a suitable environment for the seeds to grow. After that, I will use the seeds to grow plants in the foundry. Once the plants are grown, I will focus on them to ensure they are healthy and thriving. Then, I will go to the living room to get a male plant and bring it back to the foundry to cross-pollinate with the female plant. Finally, I will focus on the grown orange to complete the task.
