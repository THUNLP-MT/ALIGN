INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will focus on the substance (air) to identify it. Then, I will go to the kitchen to find a substance that can be used to change the state of matter of the air, such as a substance that can be heated. Next, I will use the substance to heat the air, which will cause it to change its state of matter. However, since the task is to melt tin, I will need to find tin and a heat source. So, I will go to the kitchen to find tin and a heat source, such as a stove or a flame. Then, I will use the heat source to melt the tin.
