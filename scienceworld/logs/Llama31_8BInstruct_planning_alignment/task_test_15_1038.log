INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the hallway to search for the inclined planes (aluminum and platinum). Then, I will pick up the aluminum inclined plane and move it to the kitchen. Next, I will pick up the platinum inclined plane and move it to the kitchen. After that, I will place the aluminum inclined plane on the table and use the stopwatch to measure the time it takes for an object to roll down the inclined plane. Then, I will place the platinum inclined plane on the table and use the stopwatch to measure the time it takes for an object to roll down the inclined plane. Next, I will compare the times measured for both inclined planes to determine which one has the most friction. Finally, I will focus on the inclined plane with the most friction.
