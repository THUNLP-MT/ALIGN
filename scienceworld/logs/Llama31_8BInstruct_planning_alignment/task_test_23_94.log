INFO - ========== Task Name: mendelian-genetics-known-plant | Task ID: 23-94 ==========
INFO - Task: This room is called the greenhouse. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a bee hive. The bee hive door is closed. 
	a blue box (containing nothing)
	a flower pot 3 (containing soil)
	a flower pot 4 (containing soil)
	a flower pot 5 (containing soil)
	a flower pot 6 (containing soil)
	a flower pot 7 (containing soil)
	a flower pot 8 (containing soil)
	a green box (containing nothing)
	a jug (containing nothing)
	a seed jar (containing a round orange pea seed, a wrinkly orange pea seed)
	a shovel
	a sink, which is turned off. In the sink is: nothing.
You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
	A door to the outside (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will pick up the round orange pea seed from the seed jar. Then, I will pick up the wrinkly orange pea seed from the seed jar. Next, I will plant the round orange pea seed in flower pot 3 and the wrinkly orange pea seed in flower pot 4. After that, I will water the seeds in the flower pots using the sink. Then, I will wait for the seeds to grow into pea plants. Once the plants have grown, I will observe the shape of the seeds produced by each plant. If the round seed shape is dominant, I will focus on the green box. If the round seed shape is recessive, I will focus on the blue box.
INFO - Agent Action: pick up the round orange pea seed from the seed jar.
INFO - Observation: You cannot pick up an item directly from a container like that. Try picking up the container first (e.g., 'pick up [container name]'), then move the item from the container (now in your inventory) to the desired location (e.g., 'move [item name] in [container name] to [destination]').
