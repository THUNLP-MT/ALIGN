INFO - ========== Task Name: test-conductivity | Task ID: 27-676 ==========
INFO - Task: This room is called the bathroom. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a bathtub, which is turned off. In the bathtub is: nothing.
	a glass cup (containing nothing)
	a picture
	a sink, which is turned off. In the sink is: nothing.
	a toilet. In the toilet is: A drain, which is open, a substance called water.
You also see:
	A door to the kitchen (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the workshop to locate the sodium chloride. Then, I will use a multimeter to test if the sodium chloride is electrically conductive. If it is conductive, I will then go to the room with the green box and use the multimeter to verify the conductivity again. If it is indeed conductive, I will then move the sodium chloride to the green box. If it is not conductive, I will then go to the room with the blue box and move the sodium chloride there.
