INFO - Task: This room is called the workshop. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a table. On the table is: a battery, a black wire, a orange light bulb, which is off, a orange wire, a red wire, a switch, which is off, a violet light bulb, which is off, a yellow light bulb, which is off.
	a ultra low temperature freezer. The ultra low temperature freezer door is closed. 
You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the outside location to find the animal with the longest life span. Then, I will look around to identify the animals present. Next, I will read the note on the tortoise to determine its life span. After that, I will read the note on the whale to determine its life span. Then, I will compare the life spans of the tortoise and the whale to determine which one has the longest life span. Once I have identified the animal with the longest life span, I will go back to the workshop. Then, I will go to the outside location again to find the animal with the shortest life span. Next, I will look around to identify the animals present. After that, I will read the note on the mayfly to determine its life span. Then, I will read the note on the whale to determine its life span. Next, I will compare the life spans of the mayfly and the whale to determine which one has the shortest life span.
