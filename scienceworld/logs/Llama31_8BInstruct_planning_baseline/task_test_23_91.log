INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will teleport to a genetics laboratory. Then, I will look around to gather information about the available equipment and resources. Next, I will read a note or book about Mendelian genetics to understand the concept of dominant and recessive traits. After that, I will look for pea plants in the laboratory and examine their seeds to determine the round seed shape trait. Once I have the necessary information, I will use the knowledge of Mendelian genetics to determine whether the round seed shape is a dominant or recessive trait. If it is dominant, I will focus on the green box; if it is recessive, I will focus on the blue box.
INFO - Agent Action: look around
