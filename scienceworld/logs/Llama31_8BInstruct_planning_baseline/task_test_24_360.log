INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the hallway to search for a lab or a room that might have the necessary equipment to conduct experiments on the D plant. Then, I will look for a book or a note that explains the genetics of the D plant, specifically the inheritance of the spherical seed shape trait. Next, I will read the book or note to understand the genetic basis of the trait. After that, I will look for a red box and a green box, which will likely contain seeds or plants of the D plant with different genotypes. Then, I will examine the seeds or plants to determine whether the spherical seed shape is dominant or recessive. Finally, I will focus on the red box if the trait is dominant and on the green box if the trait is recessive.
