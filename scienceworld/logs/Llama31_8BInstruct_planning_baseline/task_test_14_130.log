INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the kitchen. Then, I will look around to find the inclined planes C and H. Next, I will pick up plane C and move it to the bathroom. After that, I will place plane C on the bathtub and use the sink to create a ramp. Then, I will measure the height of the water level in the sink and the distance it travels down the ramp. Next, I will repeat the process with plane H. After that, I will compare the two measurements to determine which plane has the shallowest angle. Finally, I will focus on the inclined plane with the shallowest angle.
