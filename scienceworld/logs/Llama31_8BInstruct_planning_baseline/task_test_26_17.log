INFO - ========== Task Name: power-component-renewable-vs-nonrenewable-energy | Task ID: 26-17 ==========
INFO - Task: This outside location is called the outside. Here you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	an axe
	a fire pit (containing nothing)
	a fountain (containing nothing)
	the ground
	a substance called wood
You also see:
	A door to the foundry (that is open)
	A door to the greenhouse (that is open)
	A door to the kitchen (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will focus on the electric buzzer. Then, I will go to the kitchen to find a nonrenewable power source, which is likely a battery. Next, I will pick up the battery and move it to the kitchen to examine it further. After that, I will look at the battery to determine its type and whether it's functional. Once I have a working battery, I will go to the foundry to find a device that can be used to create an electrical circuit, such as a wire or a switch. Then, I will pick up the wire or switch and move it to the foundry to examine it further. Next, I will look at the wire or switch to determine its type and whether it's functional. After that, I will connect the battery to the wire or switch to create a simple electrical circuit. Finally, I will connect the circuit to the electric buzzer to power it on.
INFO - Agent Action: go to the kitchen
INFO - Observation: You move to the kitchen.
