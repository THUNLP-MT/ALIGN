INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will focus on the substance air. Then, I will pick up the shovel. Next, I will go to the sink and use the shovel to scoop up some air from the greenhouse. Then, I will close the greenhouse door to trap the air inside. After that, I will use the shovel to pour the trapped air into the jug. Next, I will close the jug to seal the air inside. Then, I will go to the hallway and use the jug to dunk it into the outside environment, where the air will be heated by the sun. After that, I will wait for the air to heat up and expand, causing it to change its state from a gas to a liquid.
