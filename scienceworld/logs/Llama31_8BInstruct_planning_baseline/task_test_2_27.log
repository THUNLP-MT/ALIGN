INFO - ========== Task Name: chemistry-mix | Task ID: 2-27 ==========
INFO - Task: This room is called the art studio. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a large cupboard. The large cupboard door is closed. 
	a table. On the table is: a glass cup (containing nothing).
	a wood cup (containing blue paint)
	a wood cup (containing yellow paint)
	a wood cup (containing red paint)
You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the hallway to find the kitchen. Then, I will look for a recipe to create red paper. Next, I will read the recipe to understand the necessary ingredients and steps. After that, I will go back to the art studio and pick up the wood cup containing red paint. Then, I will mix the red paint with air to create a paint-based substance. Next, I will use the glass cup to mix the paint-based substance with a substance called paper (which I will assume is available in the art studio or can be obtained from another location). After that, I will mix the resulting substance to create red paper. Finally, I will focus on the red paper.
