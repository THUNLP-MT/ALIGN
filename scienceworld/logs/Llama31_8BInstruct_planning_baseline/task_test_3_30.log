After that, I will look in the drawer to find a container for mixing chemicals. Following that, I will go to the cupboard and take out a substance called potassium dichromate. Then, I will go to the counter and take out the glass jar containing sodium chloride. Next, I will mix potassium dichromate and sodium chloride in the glass jar.
