INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the workshop to locate the sodium chloride. Then, I will use the multimeter to test if the sodium chloride is electrically conductive. If it is conductive, I will connect the sodium chloride to the multimeter and check for any electrical current. If it is nonconductive, I will simply observe the sodium chloride without connecting it to the multimeter. After determining the conductivity, I will go to the living room and use the yellow box if the sodium chloride is conductive, or the purple box if it is nonconductive.
