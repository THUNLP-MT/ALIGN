INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the greenhouse to obtain a D plant with spherical seeds. Then, I will go to the kitchen to obtain a D plant with non-spherical seeds. Next, I will mix the spherical seed plant with the non-spherical seed plant to create offspring. After that, I will observe the seed shape of the offspring to determine if it is spherical or non-spherical. If the offspring have spherical seeds, I will focus on the green box, indicating that spherical seed shape is a dominant trait. If the offspring have non-spherical seeds, I will focus on the blue box, indicating that spherical seed shape is a recessive trait.
