INFO - ========== Task Name: mendelian-genetics-unknown-plant | Task ID: 24-363 ==========
INFO - Task: This room is called the bathroom. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a bathtub, which is turned off. In the bathtub is: nothing.
	a glass cup (containing nothing)
	a painting
	a sink, which is turned off. In the sink is: nothing.
	a toilet. In the toilet is: A drain, which is open, a substance called water.
You also see:
	A door to the kitchen (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will teleport to a location with access to a laboratory or a room with necessary equipment to conduct experiments. Then, I will read the note or book to gather information about the D plant, its genetic traits, and the concept of dominant and recessive traits. Next, I will look in the red box and the green box to see if they contain any relevant information or materials related to the D plant. After that, I will use the information gathered to design an experiment to determine whether spherical seed shape is a dominant or recessive trait in the D plant. Then, I will go to LOC (the location where the D plant is) and pick up the D plant. Next, I will use the D plant to conduct the experiment, which may involve cross-breeding the plant with others or observing its offspring. After the experiment is complete, I will look at the results to determine whether spherical seed shape is a dominant or recessive trait. Finally, I will focus on the red box if the trait is dominant or focus on the green box if the trait is recessive.
