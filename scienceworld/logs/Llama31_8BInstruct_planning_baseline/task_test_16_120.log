INFO - ========== Task Name: inclined-plane-friction-unnamed-surfaces | Task ID: 16-120 ==========
INFO - Task: This room is called the greenhouse. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a bee hive. The bee hive door is closed. 
	a jug (containing nothing)
	a sink, which is turned off. In the sink is: nothing.
You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
	A door to the outside (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the hallway to find the inclined planes. Then, I will pick up both inclined planes and move them to the greenhouse. Next, I will close the door to the hallway and the door to the outside to isolate the greenhouse environment. After that, I will use the sink to create a controlled environment by filling it with air from the jug. Then, I will place one inclined plane on the sink and measure the force required to move it, and repeat the process with the other inclined plane. Finally, I will compare the forces required to move each inclined plane and focus on the one with the most friction.
