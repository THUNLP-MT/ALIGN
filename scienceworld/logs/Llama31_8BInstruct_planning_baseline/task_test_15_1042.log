INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the kitchen to find the inclined planes (aluminum and zinc). Then, I will pick up the aluminum inclined plane and move it to the bathroom. Next, I will pick up the zinc inclined plane and move it to the bathroom. After that, I will place the aluminum inclined plane on the bathtub and measure the force required to slide it. Then, I will place the zinc inclined plane on the bathtub and measure the force required to slide it. Finally, I will compare the two forces and focus on the inclined plane with the most friction.
