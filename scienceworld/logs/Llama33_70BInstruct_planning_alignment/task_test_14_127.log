	A door to the hallway (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the hallway to look for the inclined planes B and H, then I will examine each inclined plane to identify any measurable characteristics, next I will use a suitable method to measure the angles of the inclined planes, after that I will compare the measured angles to determine which one has the steepest angle, and finally I will focus on the inclined plane with the steepest angle.
