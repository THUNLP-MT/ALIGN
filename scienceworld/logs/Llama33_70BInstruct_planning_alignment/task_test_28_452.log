INFO - ========== Task Name: test-conductivity-of-unknown-substances | Task ID: 28-452 ==========
INFO - Task: This room is called the living room. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a book shelf (containing A book (Pride and Prejudice) titled Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen, A book (Sherlock Holmes) titled Sherlock Holmes by Arthur Conan Doyle)
	a chair. On the chair is: nothing.
	a couch. On the couch is: a white pillow.
	a desk. On the desk is: a drawer.
	a drawing
You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the hallway and then navigate to the workshop to locate the unknown substance U. Then, I will focus on the unknown substance U to identify it. Next, I will use a device, likely a multimeter, to test if the substance U is electrically conductive. After determining its conductivity, if it is electrically conductive, I will pick up the substance U and move it to the blue box, otherwise, I will move it to the orange box.
