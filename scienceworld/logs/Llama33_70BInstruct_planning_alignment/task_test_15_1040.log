INFO - ========== Task Name: inclined-plane-friction-named-surfaces | Task ID: 15-1040 ==========
INFO - Task: This room is called the foundry. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a blast furnace, which is turned off. The blast furnace door is closed. 
	a sink, which is turned off. In the sink is: nothing.
	a table. On the table is: nothing.
You also see:
	A door to the outside (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to a location where the inclined planes are likely to be, such as a laboratory or a storage room, by going through the open outside door. Then, I will look around to find the inclined planes made of aluminum and platinum. Next, I will pick up the inclined planes and move them to the foundry or a suitable location for the experiment. After that, I will acquire or find objects with similar weights to use for the experiment. I will then place each object on each inclined plane and measure the friction by observing how easily or difficultly the objects slide down, possibly using additional tools if necessary. Once I have determined which inclined plane has the most friction, I will focus on that inclined plane to complete the task.
