	A door to the foundry (that is open)
	A door to the greenhouse (that is open)
	A door to the kitchen (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the kitchen to look for the electric buzzer and other necessary electrical components. Then, I will look around the kitchen to identify the electric buzzer, a power source, and any other required items such as wires or a switch. Next, I will focus on the electric buzzer. After that, I will look for a power source, such as a battery or an electrical outlet, and connect it to the electric buzzer using wires or other necessary connectors. If the power source is not readily available, I will search the foundry or other rooms for it. Once I have all the necessary components, I will create an electrical circuit by connecting the power source to the electric buzzer, and finally, I will activate the power source to turn on the electric buzzer.
