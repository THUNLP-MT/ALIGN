INFO - ========== Task Name: inclined-plane-friction-unnamed-surfaces | Task ID: 16-120 ==========
INFO - Task: This room is called the greenhouse. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a bee hive. The bee hive door is closed. 
	a jug (containing nothing)
	a sink, which is turned off. In the sink is: nothing.
You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
	A door to the outside (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the hallway to explore and find the inclined planes made of unknown materials D and H. Then, I will look around to identify any objects or substances that can be used to test friction, such as blocks or balls. Next, I will pick up the objects and move them to the inclined planes. After that, I will use the objects to test the friction on each inclined plane by releasing them and observing which one slows down or stops first. Once I have determined which inclined plane has the most friction, I will focus on that inclined plane to complete the task.
