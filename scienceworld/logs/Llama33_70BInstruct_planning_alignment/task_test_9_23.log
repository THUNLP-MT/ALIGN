INFO - ========== Task Name: freeze | Task ID: 9-23 ==========
INFO - Task: This room is called the bathroom. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a bathtub, which is turned off. In the bathtub is: nothing.

	a sink, which is turned off. In the sink is: nothing.
	a toilet. In the toilet is: A drain, which is open, a substance called water.
You also see:
	A door to the kitchen (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will focus on tin, but since tin is not present in the bathroom, I will go to the kitchen to find it. Then, I will look around the kitchen to locate tin. After finding tin, I will use a device or method to lower its temperature. Since the environment doesn't explicitly mention a freezer, I will look for alternative methods such as using ice or a cold substance to cool the tin down. If necessary, I will use the sink or other available objects to achieve this. Once I have a means to cool the tin, I will apply it to the tin to cause it to change its state of matter from solid to solid (if it's already solid) or from liquid to solid (if it's in a liquid state), effectively freezing it if it's not already in a solid state.
