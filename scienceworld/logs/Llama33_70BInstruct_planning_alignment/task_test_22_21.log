INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will focus on lead, but since lead is not present in the current room, I will go to the kitchen to look for it. Then, I will look around the kitchen to find a source of heat, such as a stove or oven, and also search for lead. Next, I will pick up the lead and any necessary utensils or containers. After that, I will use the stove or oven to heat the lead, and I will use a container, like a pot or pan, to hold the lead while it's being heated. Once the lead is heated sufficiently, it should melt, thus changing its state of matter from solid to liquid.
