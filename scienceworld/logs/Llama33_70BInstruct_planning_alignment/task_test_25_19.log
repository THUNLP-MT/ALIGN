INFO - ========== Task Name: power-component | Task ID: 25-19 ==========
INFO - Task: This room is called the greenhouse. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a bee hive. The bee hive door is closed. 
	a jug (containing nothing)
	a shovel
	a sink, which is turned off. In the sink is: nothing.
You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
	A door to the outside (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will look around to ensure I have a complete understanding of the environment, then I will focus on the electric buzzer, but since it's not present in the current room, I will go to an adjacent room to find necessary components for creating an electrical circuit, such as a power source, wires, and the electric buzzer itself, then I will pick up the necessary components, next I will connect these components to create a circuit, and finally, I will activate the power source to turn on the electric buzzer.
INFO - Agent Action: look around
