INFO - ========== Task Name: mendelian-genetics-unknown-plant | Task ID: 24-360 ==========
INFO - Task: This room is called the living room. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a book shelf (containing A book (Sherlock Holmes) titled Sherlock Holmes by Arthur Conan Doyle)
	a chair. On the chair is: nothing.
	a couch. On the couch is: a white pillow.
	a finger painting
	a table. On the table is: nothing.
You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the hallway to explore other rooms, then I will look around to find any relevant objects, books, or notes related to genetics or plant traits, next I will read any relevant books or notes to gather information about dominant and recessive traits, after that I will try to find the unknown D plant or any seeds to observe their shape, subsequently I will use my knowledge to determine whether spherical seed shape is dominant or recessive, and finally I will focus on either the red box or the green box based on my conclusion.

INFO - Agent Action: move the spherical unknown D seed to the table
INFO - Observation: The action 'move the spherical unknown D seed to the table' was not recognized. This might be because the target object(s) are not present or accessible from your current location/inventory, or the object name is misspelled. Use 'look around' or 'inventory' to check available objects/names, or 'go to' another location if necessary.

	an orange
	a seed jar (containing a spherical unknown D seed, a ovate unknown D seed)

INFO - Agent Action: open the seed jar
INFO - Observation: The seed jar is not openable.
INFO - Score: 19

INFO - Agent Action: put down the seed jar
INFO - Observation: You move the seed jar to the greenhouse.

INFO - Agent Action: look at the seed jar
INFO - Observation: a seed jar (containing a spherical unknown D seed, a ovate unknown D seed)
INFO - Score: 19
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Action: Since the seed jar contains both a spherical and an ovate unknown D seed, this suggests that the unknown D plant can exhibit both traits. In genetics, when a plant can exhibit two different traits, it is often because one trait is dominant and the other is recessive. The presence of both spherical and ovate seeds in the same jar implies that the spherical shape might be dominant, as it is often the case that dominant traits are more commonly expressed. However, without further information or a way to determine the genetic makeup of the seeds, the best course of action is to proceed based on the information given.
