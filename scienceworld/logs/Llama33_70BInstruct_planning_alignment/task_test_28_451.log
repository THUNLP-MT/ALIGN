INFO - Task: This room is called the kitchen. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a chair. On the chair is: nothing.
	a counter. On the counter is: a bowl (containing a red apple, a banana, an orange, a potato), a drawer.
	a cupboard. The cupboard door is closed. 
	a finger painting
	a freezer. The freezer door is closed. 
	a fridge. The fridge door is closed. 
	a glass jar (containing a substance called sodium chloride)
	a lighter
	a oven, which is turned off. The oven door is closed. 
	a sink, which is turned off. In the sink is: nothing.
	a substance called soap
	a stopwatch, which is deactivated. 
	a stove, which is turned off. On the stove is: nothing.
	a table. On the table is: a glass cup (containing nothing).
	a thermometer, currently reading a temperature of 10 degrees celsius
You also see:
	A door to the bathroom (that is open)
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
	A door to the outside (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the hallway and then proceed to the workshop to locate the unknown substance U. Then, I will focus on the unknown substance U to identify it. Next, I will look around the workshop to find a power source and electrical components to test conductivity. After that, I will use the available equipment to set up a conductivity test for the unknown substance U. Once the test is set up, I will use it to determine if the substance is electrically conductive or nonconductive. If it is conductive, I will place it in the green box; if it is nonconductive, I will place it in the blue box.
INFO - Agent Action: look around
