INFO - Task: This room is called the living room. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a book shelf (containing nothing)
	a chair. On the chair is: nothing.

	a desk. On the desk is: a drawer.
	a painting
You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the hallway to explore and find the inclined planes B and H, then I will look at each inclined plane to identify any visible measurements or characteristics, next I will use any available tools or methods to measure or compare the angles of the inclined planes, after that I will compare the angles to determine which one has the shallowest angle, and finally I will focus on the inclined plane with the shallowest angle to complete the task.

INFO - Agent Action: look at inclined plane B and inclined plane H to compare them directly
INFO - Observation: The action 'look at inclined plane B and inclined plane H to compare them directly' was not recognized. This might be because the target object(s) are not present or accessible from your current location/inventory, or the object name is misspelled. Use 'look around' or 'inventory' to check available objects/names, or 'go to' another location if necessary.
