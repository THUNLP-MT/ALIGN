INFO - Task: This room is called the bathroom. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a bathtub, which is turned off. In the bathtub is: nothing.
	a glass cup (containing nothing)
	a picture
	a sink, which is turned off. In the sink is: nothing.
	a toilet. In the toilet is: A drain, which is open, a substance called water.
You also see:
	A door to the kitchen (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will focus on lead, but since lead is not present in the bathroom, I will go to the kitchen to look for it. Then, I will look around the kitchen to find lead and any necessary equipment. Next, I will pick up the lead and any required items, such as a container or a device to lower the temperature. After that, I will use the device or place the lead in the container to lower its temperature, possibly by using a refrigerator or freezer if available. If not, I will look for alternative methods to cool the lead, such as using ice or cold water. Once I have the means to lower the temperature, I will use it to cool the lead to its freezing point, thereby changing its state of matter from solid to solid, but in a frozen state, or if the lead is in a different state, I will take appropriate actions to achieve the frozen state.
