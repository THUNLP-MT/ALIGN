INFO - ========== Task Name: inclined-plane-friction-unnamed-surfaces | Task ID: 16-124 ==========
INFO - Task: This room is called the greenhouse. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a bee hive. The bee hive door is closed. 
	a jug (containing nothing)
	a sink, which is turned off. In the sink is: nothing.
You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
	A door to the outside (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the hallway to explore and find the inclined planes made of unknown materials C and D. Then, I will look around to identify any objects or substances that can be used to test friction, such as blocks or balls. Next, I will pick up the objects and move them to the greenhouse or a suitable location for the experiment. After that, I will use the objects to test the friction on each inclined plane by releasing them and observing their motion. I will then compare the results to determine which inclined plane has the most friction. Finally, I will focus on the inclined plane with the most friction to complete the task.
