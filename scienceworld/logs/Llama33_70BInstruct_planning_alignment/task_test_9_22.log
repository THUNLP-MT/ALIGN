INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will focus on tin, but since tin is not present in the living room, I will go to the hallway and explore adjacent rooms to find tin. Then, I will pick up the tin and move it to a location where I can freeze it, likely a freezer or an ice-filled container. Next, I will put the tin into the freezer or ice-filled container. After that, I will wait for a duration to allow the tin to freeze. However, since the initial room description does not mention tin or a freezer, I will have to adapt my plan as I explore the environment and gather more information.
