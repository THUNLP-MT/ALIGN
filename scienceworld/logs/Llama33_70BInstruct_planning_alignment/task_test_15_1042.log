	a substance called air
	a bathtub, which is turned off. In the bathtub is: nothing.

You also see:
	A door to the kitchen (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the kitchen to look for the inclined planes and other necessary materials, then I will look around the kitchen to identify the locations of the aluminum and zinc inclined planes, next I will pick up the inclined planes and any other required items, after that I will set up an experiment to test the friction of each inclined plane, I will use the materials to create a surface to measure friction, then I will use the glass cup to possibly create a block or weight to test the friction, subsequently I will perform the experiment on both inclined planes, comparing their friction, and finally I will focus on the inclined plane with the most friction.
