INFO - ========== Task Name: mendelian-genetics-unknown-plant | Task ID: 24-361 ==========
INFO - Task: This room is called the art studio. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a large cupboard. The large cupboard door is closed. 
	a table. On the table is: a jug (containing nothing).
	a wood cup (containing blue paint)
	a wood cup (containing yellow paint)
	a wood cup (containing red paint)
You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will look around the art studio to ensure I have noted all objects and exits, then I will go to the hallway to explore other rooms for relevant items or information, next I will search for seeds, plants, or any objects related to the D plant to gather more information, after that I will try to find the green box and the blue box, and finally I will determine whether the spherical seed shape is dominant or recessive and focus on the corresponding box.

INFO - Agent Action: pick up seed jar
INFO - Observation: You move the seed jar to the inventory.
INFO - Score: 19
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Action: look in seed jar
INFO - Observation: Inside the seed jar is: 
	a spherical unknown D seed
	a ovate unknown D seed
INFO - Score: 19
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Action: Since there is one spherical and one ovate seed, it suggests that the spherical seed shape could be either dominant or recessive, but without more information, it's hard to determine. However, given the seeds are from the same plant type (unknown D), the presence of both shapes might imply that the spherical shape is dominant because if it were recessive, we might expect to see only ovate seeds or a higher proportion of ovate seeds if the plant is heterozygous for the trait. Therefore, the next logical step based on the task's instructions would be to focus on the green box if we are to follow the task's directive based on a potential interpretation of dominance.
