INFO - ========== Task Name: inclined-plane-friction-unnamed-surfaces | Task ID: 16-123 ==========
INFO - Task: This room is called the foundry. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a blast furnace, which is turned off. The blast furnace door is closed. 
	a sink, which is turned off. In the sink is: nothing.
	a table. On the table is: nothing.
You also see:
	A door to the outside (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to a location where the inclined planes are likely to be, such as a physics lab or a storage room, by going through the open door to the outside and exploring adjacent rooms. Then, I will look around to find the inclined planes made of unknown materials C and D. Next, I will pick up the inclined planes and move them to the foundry or a suitable location for the experiment. After that, I will acquire objects with similar weights to use for the experiment, possibly by searching nearby rooms. I will then place the objects on each inclined plane and use a method to measure the friction, such as observing which object slides down more easily or using a device if available. Once I have determined which inclined plane has the least friction, I will focus on that inclined plane to complete the task.
