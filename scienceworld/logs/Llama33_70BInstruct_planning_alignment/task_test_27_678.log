INFO - ========== Task Name: test-conductivity | Task ID: 27-678 ==========
INFO - Task: This room is called the workshop. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a orange box (containing nothing)
	a red light bulb, which is off
	a substance called sodium chloride
	a table. On the table is: a battery, a black wire, a blue light bulb, which is off, a green light bulb, which is off, a green wire, a orange light bulb, which is off, a orange wire, a switch, which is off.
	a ultra low temperature freezer. The ultra low temperature freezer door is closed. 
	a yellow box (containing nothing)
You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will focus on the sodium chloride to identify it, then I will assemble a simple circuit using the battery, wires, and a light bulb from the table, next I will connect the sodium chloride to the circuit to test its conductivity, after that, I will observe if the light bulb turns on to determine if the sodium chloride is conductive or not, and finally, I will place the sodium chloride in either the orange box if it's conductive or the yellow box if it's nonconductive.
INFO - Agent Action: look around
