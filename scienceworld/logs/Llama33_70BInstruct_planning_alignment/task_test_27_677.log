INFO - ========== Task Name: test-conductivity | Task ID: 27-677 ==========
INFO - Task: This room is called the kitchen. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a chair. On the chair is: nothing.
	a counter. On the counter is: a bowl (containing a red apple, a banana, an orange, a potato), a drawer.
	a cupboard. The cupboard door is closed. 
	a freezer. The freezer door is closed. 
	a fridge. The fridge door is closed. 
	a glass jar (containing a substance called sodium chloride)
	a lighter
	a oven, which is turned off. The oven door is closed. 
	a painting
	a sink, which is turned off. In the sink is: nothing.
	a substance called soap
	a stopwatch, which is deactivated. 
	a stove, which is turned off. On the stove is: nothing.
	a table. On the table is: a glass cup (containing nothing).
	a thermometer, currently reading a temperature of 10 degrees celsius
You also see:
	A door to the bathroom (that is open)
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
	A door to the outside (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the location where the sodium chloride is, which is likely the workshop, but since I'm currently in the kitchen, I need to find a way to get there, so I will go to the hallway and then navigate to the workshop. Then, I will look around the workshop to find the sodium chloride and the blue and orange boxes. Next, I will pick up the sodium chloride and use it to test its electrical conductivity, possibly by connecting it to a device or using a tool to measure its conductivity. After determining its conductivity, I will place the sodium chloride in the corresponding box, either the blue box if it's conductive or the orange box if it's nonconductive.
