INFO - Task: This room is called the hallway. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a finger painting
You also see:
	A door to the art studio (that is open)

	A door to the greenhouse (that is open)
	A door to the kitchen (that is open)
	A door to the living room (that is open)
	A door to the workshop (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the greenhouse to find seeds or plants that can provide information about the D plant trait. Then, I will look around the greenhouse to identify any relevant objects, such as seed jars, plants, or notes. Next, I will examine the seeds or plants to determine if they exhibit the spherical seed shape trait. After that, I will use the information gathered to determine if the spherical seed shape is a dominant or recessive trait in the unknown D plant. If necessary, I will go to other rooms, like the workshop or art studio, to find additional clues or tools. Once I have determined the trait, I will go to the room where the green and blue boxes are located, and finally, I will focus on either the green box if the trait is dominant or the blue box if the trait is recessive.
