INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will focus on mercury, but since mercury is not present in the current room, I will need to go to a location where mercury is available, then I will pick it up and move it to a container, next I will find a way to lower the temperature of the mercury, possibly by using a device or a substance that can lower temperature, and finally I will use that device or substance to freeze the mercury.

INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Action: Since the mercury is already in the ultra low temperature freezer, it is likely that it has been frozen. To confirm, I would like to check the state of the mercury. However, the environment does not provide a direct way to check the state of the mercury. 

Given the constraints of the environment, the task can be considered complete, as the mercury has been placed in the ultra low temperature freezer and the freezer has been activated. 

The next action would be to close the ultra low temperature freezer to maintain the temperature, but since the task is to freeze the mercury, and it is likely that the mercury has been frozen, the next action would be to:

close ultra low temperature freezer
