INFO - Observation: a seed jar (containing a ovate unknown D seed, a spherical unknown D seed)
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------

ACTION: look at blue box
INFO - Agent Action: look at blue box
INFO - Observation: a blue box (containing nothing)
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since the blue box is empty, I should try to determine the genetic relationship between the ovate and spherical seeds in the seed jar to figure out if the spherical seed shape is dominant or recessive.
ACTION: mix seed jar
INFO - Agent Action: mix seed jar
INFO - Observation: Mixing the contents of the seed jar does not appear to produce anything new.
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since mixing the seeds didn't produce anything new, I should try to examine the seeds more closely to see if I can determine the genetic relationship between them.

INFO - Agent Action: look at spherical unknown D seed
INFO - Observation: a spherical unknown D seed
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since I'm looking at a spherical seed, I should try to determine if it's a dominant or recessive trait by examining its genetic makeup or comparing it to the ovate seed.

INFO - Observation: a ovate unknown D seed
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
