INFO - ========== Task Name: mendelian-genetics-known-plant | Task ID: 23-94 ==========
INFO - Task: This room is called the greenhouse. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a bee hive. The bee hive door is closed. 
	a blue box (containing nothing)
	a flower pot 3 (containing soil)
	a flower pot 4 (containing soil)
	a flower pot 5 (containing soil)
	a flower pot 6 (containing soil)
	a flower pot 7 (containing soil)
	a flower pot 8 (containing soil)
	a green box (containing nothing)
	a jug (containing nothing)

	a shovel
	a sink, which is turned off. In the sink is: nothing.
You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
	A door to the outside (that is open)
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: To determine the dominant or recessive trait of the round seed shape, I need to understand the genetic makeup of the pea plant and the possible genotypes and phenotypes involved.
ACTION: look at seed jar
INFO - Agent Action: look at seed jar
INFO - Observation: a seed jar (containing a wrinkly orange pea seed, a round orange pea seed)
INFO - Score: 16
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since the seeds in the jar are both orange, I can assume that the orange color is dominant, and the round seed shape might be related to a different gene.
ACTION: look at flower pot 3
INFO - Agent Action: look at flower pot 3
INFO - Observation: a flower pot 3 (containing soil, a substance called water)
INFO - Score: 16
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The observation of water in flower pot 3 suggests that it's a watering station, but I need to find a way to plant the seeds to observe the trait.

INFO - Score: 18
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
