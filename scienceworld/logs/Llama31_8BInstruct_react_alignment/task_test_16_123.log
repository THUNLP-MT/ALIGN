INFO - Score: 0
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The environment doesn't mention the inclined planes, so I need to explore other rooms to find them.
ACTION: go to LOC
INFO - Agent Action: go to LOC
INFO - Observation: You can't go to loc from here. Available exits: outside. Try using 'go to [location]' with one of these locations.
INFO - Score: 0
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since I can only move to locations directly connected to the foundry, I should try to find the inclined planes in the foundry itself or in the outside area.
