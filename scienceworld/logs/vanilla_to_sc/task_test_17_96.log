[Environment Feedback]: Your action 'focus on tortoise' did not succeed (Observation: "No known action matches that input.").
Possible Reasons:
- The object 'tortoise' might not exist yet, might not be ready (e.g., needs planting, mixing), or you might need to use its exact name. For tasks requiring focus based on a property (like ''animal with the longest life span''), ensure you have identified the correct specific item that has that property and are using its exact name.
Suggestion: Please check the environment state, your location, ensure the object is ready, and verify you are using the correct name and syntax.
