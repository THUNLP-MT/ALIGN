An individual organism placed under new conditions sometimes varies in a small degree and in very trifling respects such as stature, fatness, sometimes colour, health, habits in animals and probably disposition. Also habits of life develop certain parts. Disuse atrophies.
When the individual is multiplied for long periods by buds the variation is yet small, though greater and occasionally a single bud or individual departs widely from its type and continues steadily to propagate, by buds, such new kind.

Since the task is to focus on the 3 life stages of the brown bear, I will provide the answer directly.

The 3 life stages of the brown bear are:

1. Cub: The earliest stage of a brown bear's life, from birth to about 2 years old.
2. Subadult: The intermediate stage, from about 2 to 5 years old, during which the bear is still growing and developing.
3. Adult: The final stage, from about 5 years old and onwards, during which the bear has reached physical maturity.
