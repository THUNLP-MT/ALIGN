INFO - Agent Action: look at seed jar
INFO - Observation: a seed jar (containing a ovate unknown D seed, a spherical unknown D seed)
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Action: Since the seed jar contains both an ovate and a spherical seed, it suggests that the unknown D plant can exhibit both traits. However, to determine dominance, I would need more information. 

pick up seed jar
INFO - Observation: No known action matches that input.
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Action: look in seed jar
INFO - Observation: Inside the seed jar is: 
	a ovate unknown D seed
	a spherical unknown D seed
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Action: Since the seed jar contains both ovate and spherical seeds, and assuming that the presence of both shapes in the same jar implies a genetic combination, I would infer that the spherical shape is likely dominant, as it is often the case in genetics that dominant traits are expressed when both dominant and recessive alleles are present.

focus on red box
INFO - Observation: No known action matches that input.
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Action: focus on the red box
