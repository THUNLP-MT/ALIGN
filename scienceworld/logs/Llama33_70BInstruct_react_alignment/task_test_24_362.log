INFO - Score: 1
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The kitchen doesn't seem to have any direct information about the unknown D plant, so I should explore other rooms, possibly the hallway, to find clues or objects related to the task.
ACTION: go to hallway
INFO - Agent Action: go to hallway
INFO - Observation: You move to the hallway.
INFO - Score: 1
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since I'm in the hallway, I should look around to see if there are any objects, notes, or doors that could lead me to information about the unknown D plant or its traits.
ACTION: look around
INFO - Agent Action: look around
INFO - Observation: This room is called the hallway. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a painting
You also see:
	A door to the art studio (that is open)
	A door to the bedroom (that is open)
	A door to the greenhouse (that is open)
	A door to the kitchen (that is open)
	A door to the living room (that is open)
	A door to the workshop (that is open)
INFO - Score: 1
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The greenhouse seems like a likely place to find information about plants, so I should go there to see if I can find any clues or objects related to the unknown D plant.
ACTION: go to greenhouse
INFO - Agent Action: go to greenhouse
INFO - Observation: You move to the greenhouse.
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since I'm in the greenhouse, I should look around to see if there are any plants, notes, or objects that could provide information about the unknown D plant and its traits, such as seed shape.
ACTION: look around
INFO - Agent Action: look around
INFO - Observation: This room is called the greenhouse. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a bee hive. The bee hive door is closed. 
	a blue box (containing nothing)
	a flower pot 2 (containing soil, a substance called water)
	a flower pot 4 (containing soil, a substance called water)
	a flower pot 5 (containing soil, a substance called water)
	a flower pot 6 (containing soil, a substance called water)
	a flower pot 7 (containing soil, a substance called water)
	a flower pot 9 (containing soil, a substance called water)
	a jug (containing nothing)

	a sink, which is turned off. In the sink is: nothing.
You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
	A door to the outside (that is open)
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The presence of both spherical and ovate seeds in the seed jar suggests that the unknown D plant may exhibit both traits, so I should examine the seeds more closely to determine the relationship between the traits.
ACTION: look at seed jar
INFO - Agent Action: look at seed jar
INFO - Observation: a seed jar (containing a spherical unknown D seed, a ovate unknown D seed)
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since the seed jar contains both a spherical and an ovate seed, and assuming typical Mendelian genetics, the presence of both shapes suggests that spherical might be dominant and ovate recessive, but I need to consider the implications of this before acting.
ACTION: focus on blue box
INFO - Agent Action: focus on blue box
INFO - Observation: You focus on the blue box.
INFO - Score: 100
INFO - Done: True
