INFO - Observation: You move the battery to the inventory.
INFO - Score: 10
INFO - Done: False

ACTION: activate stopwatch
INFO - Agent Action: activate stopwatch
INFO - Observation: The stopwatch is now activated.
INFO - Score: 10
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: With the stopwatch activated, I can now use it to measure the time it takes for an object to roll down each inclined plane, which will help me compare their friction, so I should find a suitable object to roll down the planes.

INFO - Agent Action: pick up brick
INFO - Observation: You move the brick to the inventory.
INFO - Score: 10
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Now that I have the brick, I can use it to test the friction on each inclined plane by rolling it down and measuring the time with the stopwatch, so I should put the brick on one of the planes to start the experiment.

INFO - Agent Action: put down brick on inclined plane with unknown material D surface
INFO - Observation: No known action matches that input.
INFO - Score: 10
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------

ACTION: put down brick
INFO - Agent Action: put down brick
INFO - Observation: You move the brick to the workshop.
INFO - Score: 10
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------

INFO - Agent Action: activate stopwatch
INFO - Observation: The stopwatch is already activated.
INFO - Score: 20
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since the stopwatch is already activated, I should release the brick and let it roll down the inclined plane, then use the stopwatch to measure the time, but first, I need to make sure the brick is positioned to roll down.

INFO - Observation: No known action matches that input.
INFO - Score: 20
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------

INFO - Observation: I'm not sure how to use the brick.
INFO - Score: 20
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------

INFO - Score: 20
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I've observed the brick, and now I should try to release it or nudge it to roll down the inclined plane, but since I couldn't find a direct action to do that, I'll try to use the environment to my advantage.

INFO - Score: 20
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
