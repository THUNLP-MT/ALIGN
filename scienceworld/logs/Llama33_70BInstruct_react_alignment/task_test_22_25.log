ACTION: activate switch
INFO - Agent Action: activate switch
INFO - Observation: The switch is now activated.
INFO - Score: 37
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: With the switch activated, I should check if any of the light bulbs have turned on, as they could be a potential heat source to melt the mercury.
ACTION: look around
INFO - Agent Action: look around
INFO - Observation: This room is called the workshop. In it, you see: 
	the agent

ACTION: connect battery to orange wire
INFO - Agent Action: connect battery to orange wire
INFO - Observation: No known action matches that input.
INFO - Score: 37
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I need to connect the battery to one of the devices that could produce heat, such as a light bulb, so I should try connecting the battery directly to the orange light bulb.
ACTION: connect battery to orange light bulb
INFO - Agent Action: connect battery to orange light bulb
INFO - Observation: No known action matches that input.
INFO - Score: 37
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------

ACTION: connect battery to green wire
INFO - Agent Action: connect battery to green wire
INFO - Observation: No known action matches that input.
INFO - Score: 37
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since connecting objects is not working, I should try using an object that can directly produce heat or be used to melt the mercury, such as the ultra low temperature freezer, but first I need to open it to see if it has any other functions.
ACTION: open ultra low temperature freezer
INFO - Agent Action: open ultra low temperature freezer
INFO - Observation: The ultra low temperature freezer is now open.
INFO - Score: 37
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------

ACTION: use battery
INFO - Agent Action: use battery
INFO - Observation: No known action matches that input.
INFO - Score: 37
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
