INFO - Observation: You move to the outside.
INFO - Score: 33
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Now that I'm in the outside location, I should look around to see what animals are present and identify the one with the longest life span.
ACTION: look around

	A door to the foundry (that is open)
	A door to the greenhouse (that is open)
	A door to the kitchen (that is open)
INFO - Score: 33
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The giant tortoise is known for having a long life span, and since I see a giant tortoise egg, I should focus on it as it likely relates to the animal with the longest life span.
ACTION: look at giant tortoise egg
INFO - Agent Action: look at giant tortoise egg
INFO - Observation: a giant tortoise egg
INFO - Score: 33
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since I've identified the giant tortoise egg, which is related to an animal known for its long life span, I should now look for an actual animal that is already hatched and represents the longest life span.
ACTION: look around
INFO - Agent Action: look around
INFO - Observation: This outside location is called the outside. Here you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	an axe
	a baby chipmunk
	a fire pit (containing nothing)
	a fountain (containing a substance called water)
	a giant tortoise egg

INFO - Score: 33
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I don't see a fully grown giant tortoise, but given that giant tortoises are known for their long life span, the presence of a giant tortoise egg suggests that a giant tortoise might be nearby or the egg itself could be a clue, however, I should also consider that the task might be simplified and the egg could represent the longest life span indirectly.
ACTION: focus on giant tortoise egg
INFO - Agent Action: focus on giant tortoise egg
INFO - Observation: You focus on the giant tortoise egg.
INFO - Score: 83
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Having focused on the giant tortoise egg, which represents the animal with the longest life span, I can now shift my attention to finding the animal with the shortest life span among the ones present in the outside location.
ACTION: look at baby chipmunk
INFO - Agent Action: look at baby chipmunk
INFO - Observation: a baby chipmunk
INFO - Score: 83
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since I've already identified the giant tortoise egg as related to the longest life span, and now I've looked at the baby chipmunk, I should compare the life spans of the animals present, including the baby hedgehog, to determine which has the shortest life span.
ACTION: look at baby hedgehog
INFO - Agent Action: look at baby hedgehog
INFO - Observation: a baby hedgehog
INFO - Score: 83
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Between the baby chipmunk and the baby hedgehog, I need to determine which one has the shortest life span to complete my task.
ACTION: focus on baby hedgehog
INFO - Agent Action: focus on baby hedgehog
INFO - Observation: You focus on the baby hedgehog.
INFO - Score: 100
INFO - Done: True
