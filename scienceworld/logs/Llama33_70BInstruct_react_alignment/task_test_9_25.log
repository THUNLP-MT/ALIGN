INFO - Score: 10
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I've found the mercury in the paper cup on the table, and there's an ultra low temperature freezer in the room, which is exactly what I need to freeze the mercury.
ACTION: focus on mercury
INFO - Agent Action: focus on mercury
INFO - Observation: You focus on the mercury.
INFO - Score: 77
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Now that I'm focused on the mercury, I need to get it into the ultra low temperature freezer to change its state from liquid to solid.
ACTION: open ultra low temperature freezer
INFO - Agent Action: open ultra low temperature freezer
INFO - Observation: The ultra low temperature freezer is now open.
INFO - Score: 77
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The ultra low temperature freezer is open, so now I need to move the mercury from the paper cup into the freezer to initiate the freezing process.
ACTION: move paper cup to ultra low temperature freezer
INFO - Agent Action: move paper cup to ultra low temperature freezer
INFO - Observation: You move the paper cup to the ultra low temperature freezer.
INFO - Score: 77
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The mercury is now inside the ultra low temperature freezer, so the next step is to close the freezer and activate it to start the freezing process.
ACTION: close ultra low temperature freezer
INFO - Agent Action: close ultra low temperature freezer
INFO - Observation: The ultra low temperature freezer is now closed.
INFO - Score: 77
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: With the ultra low temperature freezer closed, I now need to activate it to initiate the cooling process that will freeze the mercury.
ACTION: activate ultra low temperature freezer
INFO - Agent Action: activate ultra low temperature freezer
INFO - Observation: The ultra low temperature freezer is already activated.
INFO - Score: 77
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The ultra low temperature freezer is activated and contains the mercury, so the freezing process should be underway, and I just need to wait for the mercury to freeze.
ACTION: wait
INFO - Agent Action: wait
INFO - Observation: You decide to wait for 10 iterations.
INFO - Score: 82
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: After waiting, I should check if the mercury has frozen by examining the contents of the ultra low temperature freezer.
ACTION: look in ultra low temperature freezer
INFO - Agent Action: look in ultra low temperature freezer
INFO - Observation: The ultra low temperature freezer isn't open, so you can't see inside.
INFO - Score: 82
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: To check if the mercury has frozen, I need to open the ultra low temperature freezer and then look inside to verify its state.
ACTION: open ultra low temperature freezer
INFO - Agent Action: open ultra low temperature freezer
INFO - Observation: The ultra low temperature freezer is now open.
INFO - Score: 82
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Now that the ultra low temperature freezer is open, I can check the contents to confirm if the mercury has successfully frozen into a solid state.
ACTION: look in ultra low temperature freezer
INFO - Agent Action: look in ultra low temperature freezer
INFO - Observation: Inside the ultra low temperature freezer is: 
	a paper cup (containing a substance called mercury)
INFO - Score: 82
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The mercury is still described as a substance, not specifically mentioned as frozen or solid, indicating that the freezing process may not have been successful or the environment doesn't provide detailed state changes.
ACTION: look at paper cup
INFO - Agent Action: look at paper cup
INFO - Observation: a paper cup (containing a substance called mercury)
INFO - Score: 82
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since the environment doesn't provide explicit confirmation of the mercury's state change to solid, and given that I've completed all steps to freeze it, I should consider the task as potentially completed based on the actions taken.
ACTION: task
INFO - Agent Action: task
INFO - Observation: Task description:
Your task is to freeze mercury. First, focus on the substance. Then, take actions that will cause it to change its state of matter.
INFO - Score: 82
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I have focused on the mercury, placed it in the ultra low temperature freezer, and waited, which should have frozen it, so I consider my task complete.
ACTION: wait
INFO - Agent Action: wait
INFO - Observation: You decide to wait for 10 iterations.
INFO - Score: 82
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
