INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The presence of both ovate and spherical seeds in the seed jar suggests that the unknown D plant may exhibit both traits, so I need to examine the seeds or related objects more closely to understand their genetic relationship.
ACTION: look at seed jar
INFO - Agent Action: look at seed jar
INFO - Observation: a seed jar (containing a ovate unknown D seed, a spherical unknown D seed)
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since the seed jar contains both an ovate and a spherical seed, I should try to find more information or a way to determine the genetic traits of these seeds, possibly by looking for notes, books, or other objects in the greenhouse that could provide genetic information.
ACTION: look around
INFO - Agent Action: look around

You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
	A door to the outside (that is open)
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The greenhouse doesn't seem to have any obvious sources of genetic information, so I should consider moving to a room that might have books, notes, or other research materials, such as the workshop or possibly the art studio, to find clues about the genetic traits of the unknown D plant.
ACTION: go to workshop
INFO - Agent Action: go to workshop
INFO - Observation: You can't go to workshop from here. Available exits: hallway, outside. Try using 'go to [location]' with one of these locations.
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since I can't directly go to the workshop from the greenhouse, I need to go back to the hallway, which connects to multiple rooms, including the workshop, to access potential research materials or clues.
ACTION: go to hallway
INFO - Agent Action: go to hallway
INFO - Observation: You move to the hallway.
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Now that I'm back in the hallway, I can access various rooms, so I should proceed to the workshop as initially planned to search for any notes, books, or equipment that could help determine the genetic traits of the unknown D plant.
ACTION: go to workshop
INFO - Agent Action: go to workshop
INFO - Observation: You move to the workshop.
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: In the workshop, I should look around for any objects, notes, or tools that could provide information about genetics, plant breeding, or specifically about the unknown D plant and its seed shape traits.
ACTION: look around
INFO - Agent Action: look around
INFO - Observation: This room is called the workshop. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a table. On the table is: a battery, a blue wire, a green light bulb, which is off, a green wire, a red light bulb, which is off, a red wire, a switch, which is off, a yellow light bulb, which is off.
	a ultra low temperature freezer. The ultra low temperature freezer door is closed. 
You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The workshop seems to be more focused on electrical components and equipment, so I should check the ultra low temperature freezer, as it might be used for storing biological samples or related research materials that could provide clues about the unknown D plant.
ACTION: open ultra low temperature freezer
INFO - Agent Action: open ultra low temperature freezer
INFO - Observation: The ultra low temperature freezer is now open.
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: With the ultra low temperature freezer open, I should examine its contents to see if there are any samples, notes, or other materials related to the unknown D plant or its genetics that could help determine the dominance or recessiveness of the spherical seed shape trait.
ACTION: look in ultra low temperature freezer
INFO - Agent Action: look in ultra low temperature freezer
INFO - Observation: Inside the ultra low temperature freezer is: 
	nothing
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since the ultra low temperature freezer is empty, I should consider other rooms or objects in the workshop that might hold relevant information, or return to the greenhouse where the seed jar with the unknown D plant seeds was found.
ACTION: go to greenhouse
INFO - Agent Action: go to greenhouse
INFO - Observation: You can't go to greenhouse from here. Available exits: hallway. Try using 'go to [location]' with one of these locations.
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I need to go back to the hallway to access the greenhouse, where the seed jar and other potentially relevant objects are located, to continue investigating the unknown D plant's traits.
ACTION: go to hallway
INFO - Agent Action: go to hallway
INFO - Observation: You move to the hallway.
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Now that I'm back in the hallway, I can proceed to the greenhouse to examine the seed jar and other objects more closely, looking for any clues or patterns that might indicate whether the spherical seed shape is dominant or recessive.
ACTION: go to greenhouse
INFO - Agent Action: go to greenhouse
INFO - Observation: You move to the greenhouse.
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since I'm back in the greenhouse, I should re-examine the seed jar containing both an ovate and a spherical unknown D seed, considering the possibility that the coexistence of both shapes might imply that spherical shape is dominant, as it often is in genetic traits.
ACTION: focus on green box
INFO - Agent Action: focus on green box
INFO - Observation: You focus on the green box.
INFO - Score: 100
INFO - Done: True
