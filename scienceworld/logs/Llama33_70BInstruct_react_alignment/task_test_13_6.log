INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: To understand the life stages of the lemon plant from earliest to latest, I should start by examining the pot that likely contains the earliest stage, which is the self watering flower pot 4 containing a lemon seed.
ACTION: look at self watering flower pot 4
INFO - Agent Action: look at self watering flower pot 4
INFO - Observation: a self watering flower pot 4 (containing a lemon seed, soil, a substance called water)
INFO - Score: 12
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Having observed the lemon seed, which represents the earliest stage, I should now look at the next stage in the life cycle, which would be the seedling stage found in self watering flower pot 1.
ACTION: look at self watering flower pot 1
INFO - Agent Action: look at self watering flower pot 1
INFO - Observation: a self watering flower pot 1 (containing a lemon tree in the seedling stage, soil, a substance called water)
INFO - Score: 12
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Now that I've observed the seedling stage, the next logical step is to examine the adult stage of the lemon tree, which is contained in self watering flower pot 5.
ACTION: look at self watering flower pot 5
INFO - Agent Action: look at self watering flower pot 5
INFO - Observation: a self watering flower pot 5 (containing a lemon tree in the adult stage, soil)
INFO - Score: 16
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Having seen the adult stage, I should now look at the reproducing stage, which is the final stage before the cycle potentially restarts, found in self watering flower pot 3.
ACTION: look at self watering flower pot 3
INFO - Agent Action: look at self watering flower pot 3
INFO - Observation: a self watering flower pot 3 (containing a lemon tree in the reproducing stage, soil)
INFO - Score: 16
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I have now observed all the life stages of the lemon plant from seed to reproducing adult, so my next step is to confirm that I have indeed focused on all the stages as required by the task.
ACTION: focus on lemon plant life stages
INFO - Agent Action: focus on lemon plant life stages
INFO - Observation: No known action matches that input.
INFO - Score: 16
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since I've observed all the stages from seed to reproducing adult, my task is essentially complete, but the environment didn't recognize my focus action, so I should try a more general action to confirm task completion.
ACTION: task
INFO - Agent Action: task
INFO - Observation: Task description:
Your task is to focus on the life stages of the lemon plant, starting from earliest to latest. The plants are located outside.
INFO - Score: 16
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The task description has been repeated, indicating that the task is still active, and I need to find another way to signal completion or progress, possibly by using the "focus on" action with a different syntax or object.
ACTION: focus on life stages of lemon plant
INFO - Agent Action: focus on life stages of lemon plant
INFO - Observation: No known action matches that input.
INFO - Score: 20
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since the environment doesn't recognize my "focus on" actions, I should try a different approach, such as using the "focus on" action with a specific object related to the task, like the lemon seed or the lemon tree.
ACTION: focus on lemon tree
INFO - Agent Action: focus on lemon tree
INFO - Observation: Ambiguous request: Please enter the number for the action you intended (or blank to cancel):
0:	focus on lemon tree (in self watering flower pot 3, in outside)
1:	focus on lemon tree (in self watering flower pot 6, in outside)
2:	focus on lemon tree (in self watering flower pot 1, in outside)
3:	focus on lemon tree (in self watering flower pot 5, in outside)

INFO - Score: 20
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The environment is asking for clarification on which lemon tree to focus on, and since my task involves all life stages, I should choose the one that represents the sequence, starting with the earliest stage, which is the seedling in self watering flower pot 1.
ACTION: focus on lemon tree (in self watering flower pot 1, in outside)
INFO - Agent Action: focus on lemon tree (in self watering flower pot 1, in outside)
INFO - Observation: No known action matches that input.
INFO - Score: 20
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The environment didn't recognize my previous action, so I should try to focus on the lemon tree in a simpler way by just using the number of the option provided earlier.
ACTION: 2
INFO - Agent Action: 2
INFO - Observation: No known action matches that input.
INFO - Score: 20
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since the environment didn't recognize the number input, I should try to simplify the action further by just using the "focus on" command with a specific object, such as the lemon seed, to see if that completes the task.
