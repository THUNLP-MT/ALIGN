INFO - ========== Task Name: mendelian-genetics-known-plant | Task ID: 23-91 ==========
INFO - Task: This room is called the bedroom. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a bed. On the bed is: a mattress. On the mattress is: a white pillow..
	a closet. The closet door is closed. 
	a picture
	a table. On the table is: nothing.
You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I need to find information about the pea plant and its traits, so I should explore the environment to see if there are any relevant objects or rooms that can provide this information.
ACTION: go to hallway
INFO - Agent Action: go to hallway
INFO - Observation: You move to the hallway.
INFO - Score: 1
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since I'm in the hallway, I should look around to see if there are any doors or objects that could lead me to information about pea plants or genetics.
ACTION: look around
INFO - Agent Action: look around
INFO - Observation: This room is called the hallway. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a painting
You also see:
	A door to the art studio (that is open)
	A door to the bedroom (that is open)
	A door to the greenhouse (that is open)
	A door to the kitchen (that is open)
	A door to the living room (that is open)
	A door to the workshop (that is open)
INFO - Score: 1
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The greenhouse is likely to have plants or information about plants, so it's a good place to start looking for information about pea plants and their traits.
ACTION: go to greenhouse
INFO - Agent Action: go to greenhouse
INFO - Observation: You move to the greenhouse.
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since I'm in the greenhouse, I should look around to see if there are any pea plants, books, or notes that could provide information about the genetics of pea plants.
ACTION: look around
INFO - Agent Action: look around
INFO - Observation: This room is called the greenhouse. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a bee hive. The bee hive door is closed. 
	a blue box (containing nothing)
	a flower pot 1 (containing soil, a substance called water)
	a flower pot 2 (containing soil, a substance called water)
	a flower pot 4 (containing soil, a substance called water)
	a flower pot 5 (containing soil, a substance called water)
	a flower pot 7 (containing soil, a substance called water)
	a flower pot 8 (containing soil, a substance called water)
	a green box (containing nothing)
	a jug (containing nothing)
	a seed jar (containing a round green pea seed, a wrinkly orange pea seed)
	a shovel
	a sink, which is turned off. In the sink is: nothing.
You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
	A door to the outside (that is open)
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The seed jar contains both round and wrinkly pea seeds, which suggests that it may hold clues to the genetics of pea plant traits, so I should examine it more closely.
ACTION: look at seed jar
INFO - Agent Action: look at seed jar
INFO - Observation: a seed jar (containing a round green pea seed, a wrinkly orange pea seed)
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The presence of both round and wrinkly seeds in the jar suggests a genetic variation, and in Mendelian genetics, round seed shape is typically a dominant trait, so I should focus on the green box.
ACTION: focus on green box
INFO - Agent Action: focus on green box
INFO - Observation: You focus on the green box.
INFO - Score: 100
INFO - Done: True
