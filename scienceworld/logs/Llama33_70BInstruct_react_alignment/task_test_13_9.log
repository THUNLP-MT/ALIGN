INFO - Observation: No known action matches that input.
INFO - Score: 16
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The correct action to signal the intent on a task object is to use the "focus on" action with the specific object, so I should use "focus on" with the object being the life stages of the pear plant, but since that didn't work, I'll try a more general approach.
