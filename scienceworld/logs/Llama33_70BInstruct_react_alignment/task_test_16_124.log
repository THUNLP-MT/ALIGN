INFO - Agent Action: go to hallway
INFO - Observation: You move to the hallway.
INFO - Score: 5
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since the inclined planes are not in the hallway, I should look around to see if there are any doors or pathways that could lead me to a room where the inclined planes might be located.
ACTION: look around
INFO - Agent Action: look around

	the agent
	a substance called air
	a picture

	A door to the kitchen (that is open)
	A door to the living room (that is open)
	A door to the workshop (that is open)
INFO - Score: 5
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The inclined planes are likely to be in a room where experiments or physics-related activities can be conducted, so the workshop seems like a plausible location to find them.
ACTION: go to workshop
INFO - Agent Action: go to workshop
INFO - Observation: You move to the workshop.
INFO - Score: 10
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I should look around the workshop to see if the inclined planes are present and if there are any other objects or tools that could be used to conduct the experiment.
ACTION: look around
INFO - Agent Action: look around
INFO - Observation: This room is called the workshop. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	an inclined plane with a unknown material D surface
	an inclined plane with a unknown material C surface
	a steel block
	a stopwatch, which is deactivated. 
	a table. On the table is: a battery, a black wire, a blue light bulb, which is off, a green light bulb, which is off, a red wire, a switch, which is off, a yellow light bulb, which is off, a yellow wire.
	a ultra low temperature freezer. The ultra low temperature freezer door is closed. 
You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
INFO - Score: 10
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: To determine which inclined plane has the most friction, I need to conduct an experiment, and using the steel block to measure the friction by sliding it down each plane could be a good approach, but first, I need to prepare the setup.
ACTION: pick up steel block
INFO - Agent Action: pick up steel block
INFO - Observation: You move the steel block to the inventory.
INFO - Score: 10
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Now that I have the steel block, I should place it on one of the inclined planes to start the experiment, and it might be useful to time how long it takes for the block to slide down, so I should activate the stopwatch.
ACTION: activate stopwatch
INFO - Agent Action: activate stopwatch
INFO - Observation: The stopwatch is now activated.
INFO - Score: 10
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: With the stopwatch activated, I can now start the experiment by placing the steel block on one of the inclined planes and measuring the time it takes to slide down, so I'll start with the inclined plane with unknown material C.
ACTION: put down steel block on inclined plane with unknown material C surface
INFO - Agent Action: put down steel block on inclined plane with unknown material C surface
INFO - Observation: No known action matches that input.
INFO - Score: 10
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: It seems I need to use a more general action to place the steel block on the inclined plane, so I'll try putting it down near the plane and see if that works.
ACTION: put down steel block
INFO - Agent Action: put down steel block
INFO - Observation: You move the steel block to the workshop.
INFO - Score: 10
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The steel block is now in the workshop, but I need to specifically place it on one of the inclined planes to start the experiment, so I'll try to use the steel block on the inclined plane with unknown material C.
ACTION: use steel block on inclined plane with unknown material C surface
INFO - Agent Action: use steel block on inclined plane with unknown material C surface
INFO - Observation: I'm not sure how to use the steel block.
INFO - Score: 10
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: It seems I need to find a way to make the steel block interact with the inclined plane in a way that allows me to measure friction, and simply placing it on the plane or using it on the plane doesn't work, so I'll try to move the steel block to the inclined plane with unknown material C.
ACTION: move steel block to inclined plane with unknown material C surface
INFO - Agent Action: move steel block to inclined plane with unknown material C surface
INFO - Observation: You move the steel block to the inclined plane.
INFO - Score: 20
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The steel block is now on the inclined plane with unknown material C, so I can start the experiment by releasing the block and measuring the time it takes to slide down using the stopwatch.
ACTION: wait
INFO - Agent Action: wait
INFO - Observation: You decide to wait for 10 iterations.
INFO - Score: 20
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: After waiting, I should have some data on how the steel block slid down the inclined plane with unknown material C, so now I need to repeat the process with the inclined plane with unknown material D to compare the results.
ACTION: move steel block to inclined plane with unknown material D surface
INFO - Agent Action: move steel block to inclined plane with unknown material D surface
INFO - Observation: You move the steel block to the inclined plane.
INFO - Score: 30
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The steel block is now on the inclined plane with unknown material D, so I can repeat the experiment by releasing the block and measuring the time it takes to slide down using the stopwatch.
ACTION: wait
INFO - Agent Action: wait
INFO - Observation: You decide to wait for 10 iterations.
INFO - Score: 30
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I have now collected data on both inclined planes, and assuming the plane with the longer time to slide down has more friction, I can compare the results and focus on the plane with the most friction.
ACTION: focus on inclined plane with unknown material C surface
INFO - Agent Action: focus on inclined plane with unknown material C surface
INFO - Observation: You focus on the inclined plane with a unknown material C surface.
INFO - Score: -100
INFO - Done: True
