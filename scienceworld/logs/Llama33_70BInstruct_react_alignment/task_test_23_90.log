INFO - ========== Task Name: mendelian-genetics-known-plant | Task ID: 23-90 ==========
INFO - Task: This room is called the bedroom. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a bed. On the bed is: a mattress. On the mattress is: a white pillow..
	a book shelf (containing A book (Moby Dick) titled Moby Dick by Herman Melville, A book (Pride and Prejudice) titled Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen)
	a closet. The closet door is closed. 
	a painting
	a table. On the table is: nothing.
You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: To determine whether round seed shape is a dominant or recessive trait in the pea plant, I need to find relevant information or resources, and since the current room is a bedroom, I should first explore other rooms to see if there's a library, laboratory, or any other place that might have useful books or equipment.
ACTION: go to hallway
INFO - Agent Action: go to hallway
INFO - Observation: You move to the hallway.
INFO - Score: 1
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since I'm now in the hallway, I should look around to see what other rooms are connected to it, which might lead me to a room with relevant information about pea plants, such as a study, library, or laboratory.
ACTION: look around
INFO - Agent Action: look around
INFO - Observation: This room is called the hallway. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a drawing
You also see:
	A door to the art studio (that is open)
	A door to the bedroom (that is open)
	A door to the greenhouse (that is open)
	A door to the kitchen (that is open)
	A door to the living room (that is open)
	A door to the workshop (that is open)
INFO - Score: 1
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The greenhouse seems like the most relevant room for finding information about plants, so I should go there to see if I can find any pea plants, books, or other resources that can help me determine whether round seed shape is dominant or recessive.
ACTION: go to greenhouse
INFO - Agent Action: go to greenhouse
INFO - Observation: You move to the greenhouse.
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Now that I'm in the greenhouse, I should look around to see if there are any pea plants, gardening books, or other resources that could provide information about the genetics of pea plants and help me determine whether round seed shape is dominant or recessive.
ACTION: look around
INFO - Agent Action: look around
INFO - Observation: This room is called the greenhouse. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a bee hive. The bee hive door is closed. 
	a flower pot 1 (containing soil, a substance called water)
	a flower pot 4 (containing soil, a substance called water)
	a flower pot 5 (containing soil, a substance called water)
	a flower pot 7 (containing soil, a substance called water)
	a flower pot 8 (containing soil, a substance called water)
	a flower pot 9 (containing soil, a substance called water)
	a green box (containing nothing)
	a jug (containing nothing)
	a red box (containing nothing)
	a seed jar (containing a wrinkly green pea seed, a round green pea seed)
	a shovel
	a sink, which is turned off. In the sink is: nothing.
You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
	A door to the outside (that is open)
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The seed jar contains both a wrinkly green pea seed and a round green pea seed, which suggests that it might hold the key to understanding the genetics of pea plant seed shape, so I should examine it more closely.
ACTION: look at seed jar
INFO - Agent Action: look at seed jar
INFO - Observation: a seed jar (containing a wrinkly green pea seed, a round green pea seed)
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since the seed jar contains both a wrinkly and a round pea seed, and I need to determine whether round seed shape is dominant or recessive, I should recall or research the basic principles of Mendelian genetics as applied to pea plants, which might be found in a book or by experimenting with the seeds.
ACTION: go to hallway
INFO - Agent Action: go to hallway
INFO - Observation: You move to the hallway.
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I should go back to the bedroom where I saw a book shelf, as it might contain a book about genetics or biology that could provide information on whether round seed shape is dominant or recessive in pea plants.
ACTION: go to bedroom
INFO - Agent Action: go to bedroom
INFO - Observation: You move to the bedroom.
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The book shelf in the bedroom contains books that might have relevant information about genetics or the characteristics of pea plants, so I should examine the books more closely to see if any of them discuss dominant and recessive traits.
ACTION: look at book shelf
INFO - Agent Action: look at book shelf
INFO - Observation: a book shelf (containing A book (Moby Dick) titled Moby Dick by Herman Melville, A book (Pride and Prejudice) titled Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen)
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The books on the shelf, Moby Dick and Pride and Prejudice, are literary classics and unlikely to contain information about genetics or pea plant traits, so I should consider other sources of information or return to the greenhouse to think about the seeds directly.
ACTION: go to greenhouse
INFO - Agent Action: go to greenhouse
INFO - Observation: You can't go to greenhouse from here. Available exits: hallway. Try using 'go to [location]' with one of these locations.
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since I need to get back to the greenhouse to think about the seeds and I'm currently in the bedroom, I should first go to the hallway, which is a direct exit from the bedroom and will allow me to access the greenhouse.
ACTION: go to hallway
INFO - Agent Action: go to hallway
INFO - Observation: You move to the hallway.
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Now that I'm in the hallway, I can directly access the greenhouse, where I can think about the seeds and recall that in Mendelian genetics, round seed shape in pea plants is typically a dominant trait.
ACTION: go to greenhouse
INFO - Agent Action: go to greenhouse
INFO - Observation: You move to the greenhouse.
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since I've recalled that round seed shape in pea plants is a dominant trait, I should now focus on the red box as per the task instructions.
ACTION: focus on red box
INFO - Agent Action: focus on red box
INFO - Observation: You focus on the red box.
INFO - Score: 100
INFO - Done: True
