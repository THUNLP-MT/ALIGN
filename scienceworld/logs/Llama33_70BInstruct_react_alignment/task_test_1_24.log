INFO - Observation: You can't go to kitchen from here. Available exits: hallway. Try using 'go to [location]' with one of these locations.
INFO - Score: 71
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since I can't go directly to the kitchen, I should go to the hallway first, which is a connected location, and then try to find a path to the kitchen or another location that can help me change the state of the mercury.
ACTION: go to hallway
INFO - Agent Action: go to hallway
INFO - Observation: You move to the hallway.
INFO - Score: 71
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I'm now in the hallway, and I see several doors, including one to the kitchen, so I should go to the kitchen to see if I can find a heat source, such as the stove, to change the state of the mercury.

INFO - Score: 71
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I've arrived in the kitchen, and I see the stove, which is a potential heat source, so I should try to use it to heat up the mercury and change its state of matter.

INFO - Score: 71
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The plastic cup with the mercury is now in the kitchen, and I see the stove, which I can use as a heat source, so I should try to activate the stove to heat up the mercury.
ACTION: activate stove
INFO - Agent Action: activate stove
INFO - Observation: The stove is now activated.
INFO - Score: 72
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The stove is activated, and I should now try to use it to heat up the mercury, possibly by placing the plastic cup on the stove or using the stove's heat in some other way to change the mercury's state of matter.
ACTION: move plastic cup to stove
INFO - Agent Action: move plastic cup to stove
INFO - Observation: You move the plastic cup to the stove.
INFO - Score: 74
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The plastic cup with the mercury is now on the stove, and the stove is activated, so I should wait for some time to allow the heat from the stove to affect the mercury and change its state of matter.
ACTION: wait
INFO - Agent Action: wait
INFO - Observation: You decide to wait for 10 iterations.
INFO - Score: 75
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: After waiting, I should check the state of the mercury to see if the heat from the stove has caused it to change its state of matter, such as vaporizing.
ACTION: look at mercury
INFO - Agent Action: look at mercury
INFO - Observation: a substance called mercury
INFO - Score: 75
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The mercury is still described as a substance, which doesn't give me enough information about its state, so I should try to examine it more closely or take another action to verify if its state has changed.
ACTION: look around

INFO - Score: 75
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The stove is turned on and the mercury is on the stove, so I should check the thermometer to see if the temperature has risen enough to cause the mercury to change its state of matter.
ACTION: read thermometer
INFO - Agent Action: read thermometer
INFO - Observation: It's not clear how to read that.
INFO - Score: 75
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since I couldn't read the thermometer, I should look at the mercury again to see if the heat from the stove has caused it to change its state of matter, such as vaporizing or melting.
