INFO - Agent Action: look at self watering flower pot 6
INFO - Observation: a self watering flower pot 6 (containing a orange tree in the reproducing stage, soil)
INFO - Score: 16
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: It seems there was an inconsistency in the observation, as self watering flower pot 6 was expected to contain an orange tree in the adult stage, but it's actually in the reproducing stage, similar to self watering flower pot 4, so I should look for the actual adult stage or consider the task complete if all stages have been observed.
ACTION: focus on orange plant
