INFO - Observation: You move to the hallway.
INFO - Score: 5
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------

	A door to the living room (that is open)
	A door to the workshop (that is open)
INFO - Score: 5
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The inclined planes are likely to be in a room where experiments or physics-related activities can be conducted, so the workshop seems like a plausible location to find them.
ACTION: go to workshop
INFO - Agent Action: go to workshop
INFO - Observation: You move to the workshop.
INFO - Score: 10
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I should look around the workshop to see if the inclined planes are present and if there are any other objects or tools that could be used to conduct the experiment.
ACTION: look around
INFO - Agent Action: look around
INFO - Observation: This room is called the workshop. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	an inclined plane with a unknown material D surface
	an inclined plane with a unknown material H surface
	a stopwatch, which is deactivated. 
	a table. On the table is: a battery, a black wire, a blue wire, a green light bulb, which is off, a green wire, a orange light bulb, which is off, a switch, which is off, a violet light bulb, which is off.
	a ultra low temperature freezer. The ultra low temperature freezer door is closed. 
	a wood block
You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
INFO - Score: 10
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: To determine which inclined plane has the most friction, I need to conduct an experiment, and using the stopwatch and the wood block could be a good starting point to measure the time it takes for the block to slide down each plane.
ACTION: pick up wood block
INFO - Agent Action: pick up wood block
INFO - Observation: You move the wood block to the inventory.
INFO - Score: 10
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I need to activate the stopwatch to measure the time it takes for the wood block to slide down each inclined plane, which will help me compare their friction.
ACTION: activate stopwatch
INFO - Agent Action: activate stopwatch
INFO - Observation: The stopwatch is now activated.
INFO - Score: 10
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: With the stopwatch activated, I should now place the wood block on one of the inclined planes and release it, starting with the inclined plane with unknown material D.
ACTION: put down wood block on inclined plane with unknown material D surface
INFO - Agent Action: put down wood block on inclined plane with unknown material D surface
INFO - Observation: No known action matches that input.
INFO - Score: 10
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I need to put down the wood block from my inventory, and since I want it to be on the inclined plane with unknown material D, I should use the "put down" action followed by the object, and then I can use the wood block on the inclined plane.
ACTION: put down wood block
INFO - Agent Action: put down wood block
INFO - Observation: You move the wood block to the workshop.
INFO - Score: 10
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The wood block is now in the workshop, so I should move it to the inclined plane with unknown material D to start the experiment.
ACTION: move wood block to inclined plane with unknown material D surface
INFO - Agent Action: move wood block to inclined plane with unknown material D surface
INFO - Observation: You move the wood block to the inclined plane.
INFO - Score: 20
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: With the wood block on the inclined plane with unknown material D, I should release it and use the stopwatch to measure the time it takes for the block to slide down, which will give me a measure of the friction.
ACTION: use stopwatch
INFO - Agent Action: use stopwatch
INFO - Observation: No known action matches that input.
INFO - Score: 20
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since the wood block is already on the inclined plane, I should let it slide down and observe the time it takes, but first I need to start measuring time, however, the action to use the stopwatch directly is not available, so I should wait and observe the block's movement.
ACTION: wait
INFO - Agent Action: wait
INFO - Observation: You decide to wait for 10 iterations.
INFO - Score: 20
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: After waiting and observing the wood block's movement on the inclined plane with unknown material D, I should now move the wood block to the inclined plane with unknown material H to compare the friction.
ACTION: move wood block to inclined plane with unknown material H surface
INFO - Agent Action: move wood block to inclined plane with unknown material H surface
INFO - Observation: You move the wood block to the inclined plane.
INFO - Score: 30
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: With the wood block now on the inclined plane with unknown material H, I should repeat the observation process to compare the time it takes for the block to slide down this plane with the previous one.
ACTION: wait
INFO - Agent Action: wait
INFO - Observation: You decide to wait for 10 iterations.
INFO - Score: 30
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Having observed the wood block's movement on both inclined planes, I should now compare the results to determine which plane has the most friction and focus on it.
ACTION: focus on inclined plane with unknown material D surface
INFO - Agent Action: focus on inclined plane with unknown material D surface
INFO - Observation: You focus on the inclined plane with a unknown material D surface.
INFO - Score: -100
INFO - Done: True
