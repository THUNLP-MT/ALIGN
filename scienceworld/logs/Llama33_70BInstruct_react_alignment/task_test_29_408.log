INFO - Observation: Inside the ultra low temperature freezer is: 
	nothing
INFO - Score: 6
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The ultra low temperature freezer doesn't have a thermometer, so I should look at the objects on the table in the workshop to see if any of them could be used to measure temperature.
ACTION: look at table

INFO - Score: 6
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: There doesn't seem to be a thermometer on the table, but since my task involves measuring the temperature of a wire, I should consider if any of the objects on the table could indirectly help me, or if I should move on to another room.
ACTION: go to living room
INFO - Agent Action: go to living room
INFO - Observation: You can't go to living room from here. Available exits: hallway. Try using 'go to [location]' with one of these locations.

INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Now that I'm in the hallway, I can access the living room, so I should go there to focus on the wire and try to find a way to measure its temperature.
ACTION: go to living room

INFO - Observation: You move to the living room.
INFO - Score: 6
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I'm now in the living room where the wire is located, but I still don't have a thermometer to measure its temperature, so I should try to find an alternative solution or object that could help.
