ACTION: focus on mercury
INFO - Agent Action: focus on mercury
INFO - Observation: You focus on the mercury.
INFO - Score: 70
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: To boil the mercury, I need a heat source, and since there's no obvious heating device here, I should look for something that can generate heat, such as connecting the battery to a circuit or using the ultra low temperature freezer in a creative way, but first, I should check what's inside the freezer.
ACTION: open ultra low temperature freezer
INFO - Agent Action: open ultra low temperature freezer
INFO - Observation: The ultra low temperature freezer is now open.
INFO - Score: 70
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The ultra low temperature freezer is not suitable for boiling mercury as it's designed for extremely low temperatures, so I should look for another heat source, such as the battery and wires on the table, to create a circuit that could heat up the mercury.
ACTION: look at table
INFO - Agent Action: look at table
INFO - Observation: a table. On the table is: 
	a battery
	a green wire
	a orange light bulb, which is off
	a orange wire
