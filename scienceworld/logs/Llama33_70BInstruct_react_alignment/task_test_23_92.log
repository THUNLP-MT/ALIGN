INFO - Score: 1
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The kitchen might have books, notes, or other resources that could provide information about the genetics of pea plants, so I should look around to see what's available.

You also see:
	A door to the bathroom (that is open)
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
	A door to the outside (that is open)
INFO - Score: 1
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The kitchen does not seem to have any direct information about pea plant genetics, so I should explore other rooms that might have books, notes, or a laboratory setup, such as a study or a laboratory, which could be accessed through the hallway.
ACTION: go to hallway
INFO - Agent Action: go to hallway
INFO - Observation: You move to the hallway.
INFO - Score: 1
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The hallway might have doors leading to rooms that could contain relevant information or resources, such as a study, library, or laboratory, so I should look around to see what options are available.
ACTION: look around
INFO - Agent Action: look around
INFO - Observation: This room is called the hallway. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a finger painting
You also see:
	A door to the art studio (that is open)
	A door to the bedroom (that is open)
	A door to the greenhouse (that is open)
	A door to the kitchen (that is open)
	A door to the living room (that is open)
	A door to the workshop (that is open)
INFO - Score: 1
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The greenhouse is a likely place to find information about plants, including pea plants, as it is a controlled environment for growing plants and may have relevant resources or notes.
ACTION: go to greenhouse
INFO - Agent Action: go to greenhouse
INFO - Observation: You move to the greenhouse.
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The greenhouse likely contains plants and possibly books, notes, or other resources about plant genetics, so I should look around to see if there are any pea plants, gardening books, or notes that could provide information about the genetics of round seed shape.
ACTION: look around
INFO - Agent Action: look around
INFO - Observation: This room is called the greenhouse. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a bee hive. The bee hive door is closed. 
	a blue box (containing nothing)
	a flower pot 2 (containing soil, a substance called water)
	a flower pot 4 (containing soil, a substance called water)
	a flower pot 5 (containing soil, a substance called water)
	a flower pot 6 (containing soil, a substance called water)
	a flower pot 8 (containing soil, a substance called water)
	a flower pot 9 (containing soil, a substance called water)
	a jug (containing nothing)
	a orange box (containing nothing)
	a seed jar (containing a round green pea seed, a wrinkly green pea seed)
	a shovel
	a sink, which is turned off. In the sink is: nothing.
You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
	A door to the outside (that is open)
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The seed jar contains both round and wrinkly green pea seeds, which suggests that it may be related to the task, and examining its contents could provide information about the genetics of pea plant seed shape.
ACTION: look at seed jar
INFO - Agent Action: look at seed jar
INFO - Observation: a seed jar (containing a round green pea seed, a wrinkly green pea seed)
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The presence of both round and wrinkly green pea seeds in the seed jar suggests that the round seed shape is likely a dominant trait, as it is often the case in genetics that dominant traits are more visible or prevalent.
ACTION: focus on blue box
INFO - Agent Action: focus on blue box
INFO - Observation: You focus on the blue box.
INFO - Score: 100
INFO - Done: True
