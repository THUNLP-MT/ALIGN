INFO - Agent Action: connect black wire to battery
INFO - Observation: Connections must specify specific points of contact on unpolarized electrical components (e.g. terminal 1, terminal 2)
INFO - Score: 60
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: To create a circuit, I need to specify the points of contact on the unpolarized electrical components, so I should connect one end of the black wire to terminal 1 of the battery.
ACTION: connect black wire to terminal 1 of battery
INFO - Agent Action: connect black wire to terminal 1 of battery
INFO - Observation: No known action matches that input.
INFO - Score: 60
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I need to connect the black wire to the battery, and since the battery has two terminals, I should specify the connection as terminal 1 to the positive terminal and terminal 2 to the negative terminal, but first, I should connect one end of the black wire to the battery.
ACTION: connect black wire to battery terminal 1
INFO - Agent Action: connect black wire to battery terminal 1
INFO - Observation: No known action matches that input.
INFO - Score: 60
INFO - Done: False
