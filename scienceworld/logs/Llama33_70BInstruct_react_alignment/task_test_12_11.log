Your task is to focus on the 4 life stages of the parrot, starting from earliest to latest.

INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The task description doesn't provide any new information, so I should try to use the "focus on" action again, but this time I will make sure to capitalize the "OBJ" as "OBJ" is usually an object, and in this case, the object is "parrot", but it's possible that the action requires a specific format, such as "focus on OBJ" where OBJ is an object that can be focused on, and "parrot" might not be a valid object to focus on, however, I will try "focus on" with a different approach.
ACTION: focus on OBJ
INFO - Agent Action: focus on OBJ
INFO - Observation: No known action matches that input.
INFO - Score: 4
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since the "focus on" action is not working with the object "parrot" or "OBJ", I should try to use the action "focus on" with a specific object that exists in the environment, but since there are no objects related to parrots, I will try to use the action "focus on" with an object that is present in the room, such as the "table".
ACTION: focus on table
INFO - Agent Action: focus on table
