INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: With solid unknown substance Y in the oven, I should close the oven to allow it to heat up and then use the thermometer to measure its melting point.
ACTION: close oven
INFO - Agent Action: close oven
INFO - Observation: The oven is now closed.
INFO - Score: 76
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The oven is now closed with solid unknown substance Y inside, and since the oven is activated, it should start heating the substance, so I should wait for it to melt and then check the thermometer to determine its melting point.
ACTION: wait
INFO - Agent Action: wait
INFO - Observation: You decide to wait for 10 iterations.
INFO - Score: 76
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: After waiting, I should check the thermometer to see the temperature at which solid unknown substance Y melted, which will allow me to determine if its melting point is above or below 150 degrees Celsius.
ACTION: look at thermometer
INFO - Agent Action: look at thermometer
INFO - Observation: a thermometer, currently reading a temperature of 10 degrees celsius
INFO - Score: 76
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
