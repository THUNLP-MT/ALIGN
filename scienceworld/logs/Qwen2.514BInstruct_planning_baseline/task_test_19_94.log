INFO - Agent Action: compare life span of baby chipmunk and baby hedgehog

Since the task is to focus on the animal with the shortest life span and we have identified two animals, a baby chipmunk and a baby hedgehog, the next step is to determine which one has the shorter lifespan. Based on general knowledge, chipmunks typically have a shorter lifespan compared to hedgehogs. Therefore, the animal with the shortest life span is the baby chipmunk.

Now that we have identified the animal with the shortest life span, no further action is required to complete the task.
