Since we've already identified the giant tortoise egg, let's compare the baby chipmunk and baby hedgehog. 

Given that we need to find the animal with the shortest life span next, and since we have already observed the baby chipmunk and baby hedgehog, we can infer from general knowledge that chipmunks typically have a shorter lifespan compared to hedgehogs.

Since we have already observed the baby chipmunk, let's now focus on the baby hedgehog to confirm and compare.
