INFO - ========== Task Name: inclined-plane-determine-angle | Task ID: 14-129 ==========
INFO - Task: This room is called the foundry. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a blast furnace, which is turned off. The blast furnace door is closed. 
	a sink, which is turned off. In the sink is: nothing.
	a table. On the table is: nothing.
You also see:
	A door to the outside (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the outside to find objects C and H. Then, I will bring them inside to the foundry. Next, I will use the table to place both objects and compare their angles to determine which one is steeper. Finally, I will focus on the inclined plane with the steepest angle.
INFO - Agent Action: go to outside
INFO - Observation: You move to the outside.

	an axe
	a fire pit (containing nothing)
	a fountain (containing a substance called water)
	the ground
	a shovel
	a substance called wood

Since the objects C and H are not immediately available in the foundry, I will first go back outside to pick them up and then return to the foundry to compare them. After placing both objects on the table, I will focus on each one to determine which has the steepest angle. However, since the environment does not support the direct comparison action, I will assume that focusing on each object will help me identify the steepest angle.

First, I will pick up C.
