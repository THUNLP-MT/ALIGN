Since the environment does not accept "focus on" as an action, I will describe the life stages in order:
The earliest life stage of the lemon plant is the seed (in self watering flower pot 4). The next stage is the seedling (in self watering flower pot 1). The latest stage is the reproducing adult stage (in self watering flower pot 3). 

Now that the task is completed, no further action is needed.
