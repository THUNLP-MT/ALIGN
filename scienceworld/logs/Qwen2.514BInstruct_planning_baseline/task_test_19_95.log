INFO - Agent Action: look at chameleon egg
look at parrot egg
look at baby rabbit

Based on the observation, I will focus on the chameleon egg, parrot egg, and baby rabbit to determine which animal has the shortest life span. Chameleons and parrots typically have longer life spans than rabbits, so the chameleon egg or parrot egg is likely to be the animal with the shortest life span. However, I will confirm by looking at each one. Let's start with the chameleon egg.
