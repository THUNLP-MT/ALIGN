# Observation from the environment
You move to the kitchen.

Your task is to turn on the electric buzzer by powering it using a renewable power source. First, focus on the electric buzzer. Then, create an electrical circuit that powers it on.

Now you need to give your next action.

It seems there is no electric buzzer in the kitchen. Let's try another location. Given the task, we need to find the electric buzzer first. Let's check the living room next.
