# Observation from the environment
You move to the outside.

Your task is to use chemistry to create violet paint. When you are done, focus on the violet paint.

Now you need to give your next action.

Since there is no immediate resource for creating violet paint outside or in the greenhouse, let's try the kitchen next.
