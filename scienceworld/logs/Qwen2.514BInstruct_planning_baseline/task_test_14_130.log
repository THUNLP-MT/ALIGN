INFO - ========== Task Name: inclined-plane-determine-angle | Task ID: 14-130 ==========
INFO - Task: This room is called the bathroom. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a bathtub, which is turned off. In the bathtub is: nothing.
	a glass cup (containing nothing)
	a painting
	a sink, which is turned off. In the sink is: nothing.
	a toilet. In the toilet is: A drain, which is open, a substance called water.
You also see:
	A door to the kitchen (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will use the glass cup to collect water from the toilet. Then, I will pour the water into the bathtub to fill it partially. Next, I will pour the water from the bathtub onto both the painting and the sink to simulate water sliding down inclined planes. Finally, I will observe which surface allows the water to slide more slowly, indicating the shallowest angle.
