INFO - ========== Task Name: inclined-plane-friction-named-surfaces | Task ID: 15-1039 ==========
INFO - Task: This room is called the workshop. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	an inclined plane with a platinum surface
	an inclined plane with a aluminum surface
	a steel block
	a stopwatch, which is deactivated. 
	a table. On the table is: a battery, a blue light bulb, which is off, a blue wire, a green light bulb, which is off, a green wire, a switch, which is off, a violet light bulb, which is off, a yellow wire.
	a ultra low temperature freezer. The ultra low temperature freezer door is closed. 
You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
