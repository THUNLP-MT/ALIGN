INFO - Score: 1
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The greenhouse seems like a relevant location for studying plant genetics, so I'll head there.
ACTION: go to LOC [greenhouse]
INFO - Agent Action: go to LOC [greenhouse]
INFO - Observation: No known action matches that input.
INFO - Score: 1
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I'll simply move to the greenhouse.
ACTION: go to greenhouse
INFO - Agent Action: go to greenhouse

INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Now that I'm in the greenhouse, I should look around to see if there's anything related to plant genetics or the boxes.
ACTION: look around
INFO - Agent Action: look around
INFO - Observation: This room is called the greenhouse. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a bee hive. The bee hive door is closed. 
	a blue box (containing nothing)
	a flower pot 1 (containing soil, a substance called water)
	a flower pot 2 (containing soil, a substance called water)
	a flower pot 4 (containing soil, a substance called water)
	a flower pot 5 (containing soil, a substance called water)
	a flower pot 7 (containing soil, a substance called water)
	a flower pot 8 (containing soil, a substance called water)
	a green box (containing nothing)
	a jug (containing nothing)
	a seed jar (containing a wrinkly orange pea seed, a round green pea seed)
	a shovel
	a sink, which is turned off. In the sink is: nothing.
You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
	A door to the outside (that is open)
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since I need to determine whether round seed shape is a dominant or recessive trait, I should examine the seeds in the seed jar to see if I can find any information about their genetic makeup.
ACTION: look at seed jar
INFO - Agent Action: look at seed jar
INFO - Observation: a seed jar (containing a wrinkly orange pea seed, a round green pea seed)
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The presence of both a wrinkly orange pea seed and a round green pea seed suggests that I might be able to use them to determine the genetic basis of round seed shape.
ACTION: mix seed jar
INFO - Agent Action: mix seed jar
INFO - Observation: Mixing the contents of the seed jar does not appear to produce anything new.
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since mixing the seeds didn't produce anything new, I should try to examine the seeds more closely to see if I can determine their genetic makeup.
ACTION: look at seed jar
INFO - Agent Action: look at seed jar
INFO - Observation: a seed jar (containing a wrinkly orange pea seed, a round green pea seed)
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I need to determine the genetic basis of round seed shape, so I should try to figure out which seed is dominant and which is recessive.
ACTION: focus on green box
INFO - Agent Action: focus on green box
INFO - Observation: You focus on the green box.
INFO - Score: 100
INFO - Done: True
