INFO - ========== Task Name: inclined-plane-determine-angle | Task ID: 14-129 ==========
INFO - Task: This room is called the foundry. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a blast furnace, which is turned off. The blast furnace door is closed. 
	a sink, which is turned off. In the sink is: nothing.
	a table. On the table is: nothing.
You also see:
	A door to the outside (that is open)
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: To determine the steepest angle of the inclined planes, I need to first locate them and then measure their angles. Since I don't have any tools or information about the planes, I should start by examining the environment and looking for any clues or objects that might help me.
