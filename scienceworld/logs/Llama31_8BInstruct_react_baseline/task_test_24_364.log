INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I should examine the seed jar to learn more about the D plant and its seeds.
ACTION: look at seed jar
INFO - Agent Action: look at seed jar
INFO - Observation: a seed jar (containing a spherical unknown D seed, a ovate unknown D seed)
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since the seed jar contains a spherical unknown D seed and an ovate unknown D seed, I should determine if the spherical seed shape is dominant or recessive by examining the genetic makeup of the plant.
ACTION: read seed jar
INFO - Agent Action: read seed jar
INFO - Observation: It's not clear how to read that.
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I should try to examine the seed jar more closely to see if there's any information about the genetic makeup of the D plant.
ACTION: look in seed jar
INFO - Agent Action: look in seed jar
INFO - Observation: Inside the seed jar is: 
	a spherical unknown D seed
	a ovate unknown D seed
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since the seed jar contains both a spherical and an ovate seed, I should try to determine the genetic makeup of the plant by examining the seeds more closely.
ACTION: look at a spherical unknown D seed
INFO - Agent Action: look at a spherical unknown D seed
INFO - Observation: a spherical unknown D seed
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I should try to determine if the spherical seed shape is dominant or recessive by examining the genetic information associated with it.
ACTION: read a spherical unknown D seed
INFO - Agent Action: read a spherical unknown D seed
INFO - Observation: It's not clear how to read that.
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I should try to examine the seed more closely to see if I can determine its genetic makeup.
ACTION: look at a spherical unknown D seed
INFO - Agent Action: look at a spherical unknown D seed
INFO - Observation: a spherical unknown D seed
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since I'm not getting any information from looking at the seed, I should try to examine the green box to see if it provides any clues about the genetic makeup of the plant.
ACTION: look at green box
INFO - Agent Action: look at green box
INFO - Observation: a green box (containing nothing)
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since the green box is empty, I should try to examine the blue box to see if it provides any clues about the genetic makeup of the plant.
ACTION: look at blue box
INFO - Agent Action: look at blue box
INFO - Observation: a blue box (containing nothing)
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since both the green and blue boxes are empty, I should try to examine the seed jar again to see if I can find any clues about the genetic makeup of the plant.
ACTION: look in seed jar
INFO - Agent Action: look in seed jar
INFO - Observation: Inside the seed jar is: 
	a spherical unknown D seed
	a ovate unknown D seed
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since the seed jar contains both a spherical and an ovate seed, I should assume that the spherical seed shape is dominant because it is present in the seed jar.
ACTION: focus on green box
INFO - Agent Action: focus on green box
INFO - Observation: You focus on the green box.
