INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I need to activate the stopwatch to measure the time it takes for an object to roll down the inclined planes.
ACTION: activate stopwatch
INFO - Agent Action: activate stopwatch
INFO - Observation: The stopwatch is now activated.
INFO - Score: 10
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I need to place an object on the inclined planes and measure the time it takes to roll down to determine which one has the least friction.
ACTION: move wood block to inclined plane with a aluminum surface
INFO - Agent Action: move wood block to inclined plane with a aluminum surface
INFO - Observation: You move the wood block to the inclined plane.
INFO - Score: 20
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I need to measure the time it takes for the wood block to roll down the inclined plane with the aluminum surface.
ACTION: use stopwatch
INFO - Agent Action: use stopwatch
INFO - Observation: No known action matches that input.
INFO - Score: 20
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I need to measure the time it takes for the wood block to roll down the inclined plane with the aluminum surface.
ACTION: look at stopwatch
INFO - Agent Action: look at stopwatch
