INFO - Score: 10
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The wind generator seems like a suitable renewable power source, so I should focus on it to see if it can be activated.
ACTION: de/activate wind generator
INFO - Agent Action: de/activate wind generator
INFO - Observation: No known action matches that input.
INFO - Score: 10
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I should try to activate the wind generator by connecting it to a power source or turning it on.
ACTION: connect wind generator to table
INFO - Agent Action: connect wind generator to table
INFO - Observation: Connections must specify specific points of contact on polarized electrical components (e.g. anode, cathode)
INFO - Score: 10
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I need to specify the connections between the wind generator and the table, so I should try to connect the anode of the wind generator to the table.
ACTION: connect wind generator anode to table
INFO - Agent Action: connect wind generator anode to table
INFO - Observation: anode on wind generator is now connected to terminal 1 on table
INFO - Score: 10
