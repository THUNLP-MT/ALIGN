INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since I need to determine the dominant or recessive trait of the spherical seed shape in the D plant, I should first gather information about the plant itself, which is not present in this room. However, I can start by examining the objects in this room to see if there's any connection or clue related to the plant.
