INFO - Observation: No known action matches that input.
INFO - Score: 55
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I need to break the connection between the sodium chloride and the battery, so I'll disconnect the sodium chloride from the battery.
ACTION: disconnect sodium chloride from battery
INFO - Agent Action: disconnect sodium chloride from battery
INFO - Observation: No known action matches that input.
INFO - Score: 55
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since the previous actions didn't work, I'll try to disconnect the sodium chloride from the battery by specifying the connection to the cathode.
