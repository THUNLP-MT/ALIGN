INFO - Observation: You cannot go to 'table'. This might be because:
1. It's not a valid location name, is misspelled, or is not directly accessible from here. Check available exits in the room description.
2. 'table' refers to an object or area within your current location, not a separate navigable location. Use 'look around' to see objects here and interact with them directly.
