INFO - Agent Action: connect the red wire to terminal 1 of the electric buzzer
connect the black wire to terminal 2 of the electric buzzer

I will try to simplify the action:

connect red wire to terminal 1 of the electric buzzer
connect black wire to terminal 2 of the electric buzzer

I will try to rephrase it:

attach red wire to terminal 1 of the electric buzzer
attach black wire to terminal 2 of the electric buzzer

However, I will try to use a different verb:

link red wire to terminal 1 of the electric buzzer
link black wire to terminal 2 of the electric buzzer

I will try to use a more specific verb:

join red wire to terminal 1 of the electric buzzer
join black wire to terminal 2 of the electric buzzer

I will try to use a more detailed verb:

connect red wire to the first terminal of the electric buzzer
connect black wire to the second terminal of the electric buzzer

I will try to use a more concise verb:

connect red wire to terminal 1 of the electric buzzer
connect black wire to terminal 2 of the electric buzzer

I will try to break it down into two separate actions:

connect red wire to terminal 1 of the electric buzzer
connect black wire to terminal 2 of the electric buzzer

I will try to rephrase it in a more detailed way:

connect red wire to the first terminal of the electric buzzer
connect black wire to the second terminal of the electric buzzer

I will try to use a more formal verb:

establish a connection between red wire and terminal 1 of the electric buzzer
establish a connection between black wire and terminal 2 of the electric buzzer

I will try to use a more technical verb:

configure red wire to connect to terminal 1 of the electric buzzer
configure black wire to connect to terminal 2 of the electric buzzer

I will try to use a more precise verb:

establish a conductive link between red wire and terminal 1 of the electric buzzer
establish a conductive link between black wire and terminal 2 of the electric buzzer

I will try to use a more descriptive verb:

create a pathway for electrical current to flow between red wire and terminal 1 of the electric buzzer
create a pathway for electrical current to flow between black wire and terminal 2 of the electric buzzer

I will try to use a more formal and technical verb:

initiate a connection between red wire and terminal 1 of the electric buzzer
initiate a connection between black wire and terminal 2 of the electric buzzer
