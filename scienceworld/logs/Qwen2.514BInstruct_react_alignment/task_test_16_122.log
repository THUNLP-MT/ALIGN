INFO - Score: 10
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I found the inclined planes, now I need to determine which one has the most friction.
ACTION: use stopwatch on inclined plane with unknown material D surface
INFO - Agent Action: use stopwatch on inclined plane with unknown material D surface
INFO - Observation: I'm not sure how to use the stopwatch.
INFO - Score: 10
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I need to time how long it takes for an object to slide down each inclined plane to determine which has more friction.
ACTION: pick up brick
INFO - Agent Action: pick up brick
INFO - Observation: You move the brick to the inventory.
INFO - Score: 10
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Now I need to place the brick on the first inclined plane to start the experiment.
ACTION: put down brick on inclined plane with unknown material D surface
INFO - Agent Action: put down brick on inclined plane with unknown material D surface
INFO - Observation: No known action matches that input.
INFO - Score: 10
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I need to use the correct action to place the brick on the inclined plane.
ACTION: use brick on inclined plane with unknown material D surface
INFO - Agent Action: use brick on inclined plane with unknown material D surface
INFO - Observation: I'm not sure how to use the brick.
INFO - Score: 10
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I need to manually place the brick on the inclined plane.
ACTION: put down brick on inclined plane with unknown material D surface
INFO - Agent Action: put down brick on inclined plane with unknown material D surface
INFO - Observation: No known action matches that input.
INFO - Score: 10
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The system does not recognize the action, I need to try a different approach.
