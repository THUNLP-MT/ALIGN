INFO - Score: 10
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I found the inclined planes, now I need to conduct the experiment to determine which one has the most friction.
ACTION: pick up wood block
INFO - Agent Action: pick up wood block
INFO - Observation: You move the wood block to the inventory.
INFO - Score: 10
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I need to place the wood block on the inclined planes to test the friction.
ACTION: put down wood block on inclined plane with aluminum surface
INFO - Agent Action: put down wood block on inclined plane with aluminum surface
INFO - Observation: No known action matches that input.
INFO - Score: 10
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I need to specify the action to place the wood block on the inclined plane correctly.
ACTION: use wood block on inclined plane with aluminum surface
INFO - Agent Action: use wood block on inclined plane with aluminum surface
INFO - Observation: I'm not sure how to use the wood block.
INFO - Score: 10
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I need to place the wood block on the inclined plane directly.
ACTION: put down wood block on inclined plane with aluminum surface
INFO - Agent Action: put down wood block on inclined plane with aluminum surface
INFO - Observation: No known action matches that input.
INFO - Score: 10
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The action needs to be more specific. I will try placing the wood block on the inclined plane by focusing on it first.
ACTION: focus on inclined plane with aluminum surface
