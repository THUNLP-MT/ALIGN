ACTION: use steel block on inclined plane with unknown material D
INFO - Agent Action: use steel block on inclined plane with unknown material D
INFO - Observation: No known action matches that input.
INFO - Score: 10
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The environment does not seem to recognize the action directly. I should try a more explicit action.
ACTION: put down steel block next to inclined plane with unknown material D
INFO - Agent Action: put down steel block next to inclined plane with unknown material D
INFO - Observation: No known action matches that input.
INFO - Score: 10
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The environment requires a more direct action to start the experiment.
ACTION: focus on inclined plane with unknown material D
ACTION: use steel block on inclined plane with unknown material D

Since the environment only allows one action per response, I will first focus on the inclined plane to signal my intent, then proceed with using the steel block.
ACTION: focus on inclined plane with unknown material D
INFO - Agent Action: focus on inclined plane with unknown material D
INFO - Observation: No known action matches that input.
INFO - Score: 10
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The environment seems to require a specific action to start the experiment. I will try to release the steel block directly.
ACTION: release steel block on inclined plane with unknown material D
INFO - Agent Action: release steel block on inclined plane with unknown material D
INFO - Observation: No known action matches that input.
INFO - Score: 10
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The environment does not recognize the specific action to release the block. I will try placing the block on the inclined plane and then signal the start of the experiment.
ACTION: put down steel block on inclined plane with unknown material D
INFO - Agent Action: put down steel block on inclined plane with unknown material D
INFO - Observation: No known action matches that input.
INFO - Score: 10
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The environment does not recognize the action "put down steel block on inclined plane." I will try a different approach by focusing on the block and then the plane.
ACTION: focus on steel block
ACTION: use steel block on inclined plane with unknown material D

Since the environment only allows one action at a time, I will first focus on the steel block.
ACTION: focus on steel block
INFO - Agent Action: focus on steel block
