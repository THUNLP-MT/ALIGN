Next, I will plant the wrinkly green pea seed and the round green pea seed in separate flower pots. After that, I will wait for the pea plants to grow. Once the plants are grown, I will observe their seed shapes and determine if the round seed shape is dominant or recessive. If the round seed shape is dominant, I will focus on the red box.

[Environment Feedback]: Your action 'go to flower pot 2 from greenhouse' uses an invalid command format.
Reason: The 'go to' action only accepts the destination location name (e.g., 'go to flower pot 2' or 'go to hallway'). Specifying the source location using 'from greenhouse' is not supported.
Suggestion: Please use 'look around' to see valid exits from your current location (the greenhouse) and then use 'go to [valid exit]'.
