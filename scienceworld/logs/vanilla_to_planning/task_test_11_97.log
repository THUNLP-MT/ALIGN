INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the living room to find a seed. Then, I will bring the seed to the foundry. Next, I will focus on the seed. After that, I will go to the sink and fill it with water. Then, I will put the seed in the sink to soak it. Later, I will go to the blast furnace, open it, and place the seed inside. Finally, I will activate the blast furnace to grow the plant until it reaches the reproduction life stage.

[Environment Feedback]: Your action 'focus on seed' did not succeed (Observation: "No known action matches that input.").
Possible Reasons:
- The object 'seed' might not exist yet, might not be ready (e.g., needs planting, mixing), or you might need to use its exact name. Check the task steps and ensure all prerequisites are met. For planted items, the name might be like 'orange seed in flower pot'.
Suggestion: Please check the environment state, your location, ensure the object is ready, and verify you are using the correct name and syntax.
