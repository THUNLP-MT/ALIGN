INFO - ========== Task Name: inclined-plane-friction-unnamed-surfaces | Task ID: 16-120 ==========
INFO - Task: This room is called the greenhouse. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a bee hive. The bee hive door is closed. 
	a jug (containing nothing)
	a sink, which is turned off. In the sink is: nothing.
You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
	A door to the outside (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the hallway to find material D and material H. Then, I will create two inclined planes using material D and material H. Next, I will place a small object on each inclined plane and observe which one stops moving first to determine which has the most friction. Finally, I will focus on the inclined plane with the most friction.
INFO - Agent Action: look around
