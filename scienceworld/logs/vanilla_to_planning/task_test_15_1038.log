INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the hallway. Then, I will go to the outside. Next, I will find the aluminum and platinum inclined planes. After that, I will set up the aluminum inclined plane and add a block to it. Then, I will use the stopwatch to measure the time it takes for the block to slide down. Next, I will repeat the process with the platinum inclined plane. Finally, I will focus on the inclined plane with the most friction.
