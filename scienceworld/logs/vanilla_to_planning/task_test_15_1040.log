INFO - ========== Task Name: inclined-plane-friction-named-surfaces | Task ID: 15-1040 ==========
INFO - Task: This room is called the foundry. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a blast furnace, which is turned off. The blast furnace door is closed. 
	a sink, which is turned off. In the sink is: nothing.
	a table. On the table is: nothing.
You also see:
	A door to the outside (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the outside. Then, I will find or create two inclined planes made of aluminum and platinum. Next, I will set up the aluminum inclined plane and pour some sand on it to increase friction. After that, I will set up the platinum inclined plane. Then, I will use a small object to slide down both inclined planes and compare the friction. Finally, I will focus on the inclined plane with the most friction.

[Environment Feedback]: Your action 'focus on aluminum inclined plane' did not succeed (Observation: "No known action matches that input.").
Possible Reasons:
- The object 'aluminum inclined plane' might not exist yet, might not be ready (e.g., needs planting, mixing), or you might need to use its exact name. For tasks requiring focus based on a property (like ''inclined plane with the most friction''), ensure you have identified the correct specific item that has that property and are using its exact name.
Suggestion: Please check the environment state, your location, ensure the object is ready, and verify you are using the correct name and syntax.
