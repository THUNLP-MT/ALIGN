INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Action: use black wire to connect battery and red wire to form a circuit with sodium chloride
INFO - Observation: This room is called the workshop. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a green box (containing nothing)
	a red box (containing nothing)
	a red light bulb, which is off
	a table. On the table is: a battery, a black wire, a blue light bulb, which is off, a green light bulb, which is off, a orange light bulb, which is off, a orange wire, a red wire, a switch, which is off.
	a ultra low temperature freezer. The ultra low temperature freezer door is closed. 
You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)

[Environment Feedback]: Your action 'use black wire to connect battery and red wire to form a circuit with sodium chloride' did not succeed as expected in the workshop (Observation: "No known action matches that input.").
Reason: This could be due to an incorrect command, a non-existent or inaccessible object, or the action not being applicable in the current situation.
Suggestion: Please check the command syntax, object names, your location, and the environment state.
