INFO - ========== Task Name: inclined-plane-friction-unnamed-surfaces | Task ID: 16-124 ==========
INFO - Task: This room is called the greenhouse. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a bee hive. The bee hive door is closed. 
	a jug (containing nothing)
	a sink, which is turned off. In the sink is: nothing.
You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
	A door to the outside (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the hallway to find the inclined planes. Then, I will pick up unknown material C and unknown material D. Next, I will go back to the greenhouse and set up an inclined plane with unknown material C. After that, I will pour water on the inclined plane to create friction. Then, I will repeat the process with unknown material D. Finally, I will focus on the inclined plane with the most friction.
INFO - Agent Action: look around

[Environment Feedback]: Your action 'go to workshop' failed (Observation: "No known action matches that input.").
Reason: You cannot go directly to 'workshop' from your current location (the greenhouse). Movement is only possible between directly connected locations.
Suggestion: Use 'look around' to see the available exits and connected locations from here.
INFO - Score: 5
INFO - Done: False
INFO - Log contents when executing `WrapStep`: WARNING - Detected potential failure phrase 'no known action' in observation string for standard action 'go to workshop'.
WARNING - Handling failure based on observation content for standard action 'go to workshop'. Failure phrase: 'no known action'.
INFO - Detected failed 'go to workshop' action, likely due to non-adjacency from the greenhouse.

INFO - Agent Action: focus on inclined plane with a unknown material C surface
INFO - Observation: You focus on the inclined plane with a unknown material C surface.

[Environment Note]: The task finished after focusing on 'inclined plane with a unknown material c surface', but the score (-100) indicates potential issues. Ensure all necessary steps and conditions were met before using the 'focus on' command.
INFO - Score: -100
INFO - Done: True
INFO - Log contents when executing `WrapStep`: INFO - Conceptual focus task detected. Allowing action 'focus on inclined plane with a unknown material C surface' targeting specific instance 'inclined plane with a unknown material c surface' to proceed, bypassing literal match check against ''inclined plane with the most friction''.
WARNING - Focus action 'focus on inclined plane with a unknown material C surface' resulted in task completion with score -100. Prerequisites might have been missed.
