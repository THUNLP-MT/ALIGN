INFO - ========== Task Name: inclined-plane-friction-unnamed-surfaces | Task ID: 16-123 ==========
INFO - Task: This room is called the foundry. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a blast furnace, which is turned off. The blast furnace door is closed. 
	a sink, which is turned off. In the sink is: nothing.

INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will pick up unknown material C and put it on the table. Then, I will pick up unknown material D and put it on the table. Next, I will use a ramp to create an inclined plane with unknown material C. After that, I will use a ramp to create an inclined plane with unknown material D. Then, I will release a small object on both inclined planes and measure the time it takes for the object to reach the bottom. Finally, I will focus on the inclined plane with the least friction.
