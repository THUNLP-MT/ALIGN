INFO - ========== Task Name: inclined-plane-determine-angle | Task ID: 14-129 ==========
INFO - Task: This room is called the foundry. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a blast furnace, which is turned off. The blast furnace door is closed. 
	a sink, which is turned off. In the sink is: nothing.
	a table. On the table is: nothing.
You also see:
	A door to the outside (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the door to the outside. Then, I will pick up a ramp or inclined plane (C or H) and move it to the table. Next, I will use a protractor to measure the angle of ramp C. After that, I will measure the angle of ramp H. Finally, I will focus on the ramp with the steepest angle.
INFO - Agent Action: look around
