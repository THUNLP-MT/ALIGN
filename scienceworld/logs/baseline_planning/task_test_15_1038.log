	a thermometer, currently reading a temperature of 10 degrees celsius
You also see:
	A door to the bathroom (that is open)
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
	A door to the outside (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the hallway to find the aluminum and platinum inclined planes. Then, I will pick up the aluminum inclined plane and put it in my inventory. Next, I will go to the kitchen counter and pick up the stopwatch and the red apple. After that, I will go to the outside and set up the aluminum inclined plane on a flat surface. Then, I will use the red apple to conduct the friction experiment by rolling it down the inclined plane and timing how long it takes. Next, I will put down the red apple and pick up the platinum inclined plane. Then, I will go to the outside and set up the platinum inclined plane on a flat surface. After that, I will use the red apple to conduct the friction experiment by rolling it down the platinum inclined plane and timing how long it takes. Finally, I will compare the times and focus on the inclined plane with the longer time, which has the most friction.
