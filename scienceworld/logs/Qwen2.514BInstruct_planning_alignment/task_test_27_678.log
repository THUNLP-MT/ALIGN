INFO - ========== Task Name: test-conductivity | Task ID: 27-678 ==========
INFO - Task: This room is called the workshop. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a orange box (containing nothing)
	a red light bulb, which is off
	a substance called sodium chloride
	a table. On the table is: a battery, a black wire, a blue light bulb, which is off, a green light bulb, which is off, a green wire, a orange light bulb, which is off, a orange wire, a switch, which is off.
	a ultra low temperature freezer. The ultra low temperature freezer door is closed. 
	a yellow box (containing nothing)
You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will pick up sodium chloride. Then, I will connect the black wire to the battery. Next, I will connect the orange wire to the black wire. Then, I will connect the green wire to the orange wire. After that, I will connect the blue light bulb to the green wire. Next, I will connect the green light bulb to the blue light bulb. Then, I will connect the orange light bulb to the green light bulb. After that, I will connect the switch to the orange light bulb. Next, I will activate the switch. Then, I will use the sodium chloride to complete the circuit between the green wire and the orange light bulb. If the orange light bulb lights up, sodium chloride is electrically conductive and I will place it in the orange box. If it does not light up, sodium chloride is electrically nonconductive and I will place it in the yellow box.
INFO - Agent Action: pick up sodium chloride
INFO - Observation: You move the sodium chloride to the inventory.

	a orange box (containing nothing)
	a red light bulb, which is off
	a substance called sodium chloride
	a table. On the table is: a battery, a black wire, a blue light bulb, which is off, a green light bulb, which is off, a green wire, a orange light bulb, which is off, a orange wire, a switch, which is off.
	a ultra low temperature freezer. The ultra low temperature freezer door is closed. 
	a yellow box (containing nothing)
You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will pick up sodium chloride. Then, I will connect the black wire to the battery. Next, I will connect the orange wire to the black wire. Then, I will connect the green wire to the orange wire. After that, I will connect the blue light bulb to the green wire. Next, I will connect the green light bulb to the blue light bulb. Then, I will connect the orange light bulb to the green light bulb. After that, I will connect the switch to the orange light bulb. Next, I will activate the switch. Then, I will use the sodium chloride to complete the circuit between the green wire and the orange light bulb. If the orange light bulb lights up, sodium chloride is electrically conductive and I will place it in the orange box. If it does not light up, sodium chloride is electrically nonconductive and I will place it in the yellow box.
