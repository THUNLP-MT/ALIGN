INFO - Agent Action: go to outside to observe the full life stages in order

Since we have the seed, seedling, and reproducing stage lemon trees observed, the next logical step is to ensure we observe the adult stage as well, which we previously noted was in self-watering flower pot 5. However, since it's showing as reproducing stage again, let's confirm by looking at it directly.
