Next, I will go back to outside to find the animal with the shortest life span. Finally, I will identify the animal with the shortest life span.
INFO - Agent Action: go to outside
INFO - Observation: The action 'go to outside' was not recognized. This might be because 'outside' is not an adjacent location, the name is misspelled, or the location doesn't exist. Movement is restricted to adjacent rooms. Use 'look around' to see available exits and verify location names.

# Observation from the environment
a parrot egg

Your task is to find the animal with the longest life span, then the shortest life span. First, focus on the animal with the longest life span.  Then, focus on the animal with the shortest life span. The animals are in the 'outside' location.

Now you need to give your next action.

Since the environment did not provide specific information about the life spans of the chameleon and parrot from just looking at the eggs, I will assume that the chameleon has a longer life span and the parrot has a shorter life span based on general knowledge. Next, I will look at the baby rabbit to confirm if it has a shorter life span than the parrot.

INFO - Agent Action: Based on the available information, chameleons generally have a longer lifespan compared to parrots and rabbits. Parrots can have a longer lifespan than rabbits. Since specific lifespan details are not provided, I will assume the chameleon has the longest lifespan and the parrot egg has the shortest lifespan among the available options.

Since I have identified the chameleon egg as the animal with the longest potential lifespan and the parrot egg as the animal with the shorter lifespan, my next step is to confirm the parrot egg as the animal with the shortest lifespan.

Given that I have already looked at the parrot egg, I will now focus on confirming the task by identifying the animal with the shortest lifespan as the parrot, based on general knowledge.
