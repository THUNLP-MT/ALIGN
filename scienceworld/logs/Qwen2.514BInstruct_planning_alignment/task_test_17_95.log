look at parrot egg
look at baby rabbit

Since direct 'look at' actions are not working, I will focus on the known longest-living animal from general knowledge, which is likely the tortoise or turtle. However, since no such animal is mentioned, I will assume one of the mentioned animals has the longest lifespan based on typical knowledge. Chameleons can live up to 10 years, parrots up to 80 years, and rabbits up to 12 years. Therefore, the parrot egg is likely the target.
