INFO - Agent Action: focus on spherical unknown D seed

Since we are trying to determine if the spherical seed shape is dominant or recessive, we should focus on the spherical seed. If the spherical shape appears in the seed jar alongside another shape, it suggests the spherical shape is dominant. Now we need to decide which box to focus on based on this information. Since the spherical shape is present, we will focus on the red box as per the task instructions. 

Next action:
go to red box
