# Observation from the environment
You move to the greenhouse.

Your task is to find a(n) living thing. First, focus on the thing. Then, move it to the orange box in the living room.

Now you need to give your next action.

Let's try a different approach since picking up the banana tree directly didn't work. We need to find a smaller living thing.
