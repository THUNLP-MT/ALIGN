INFO - Task: This room is called the bedroom. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a bed. On the bed is: a mattress. On the mattress is: a white pillow..
	a closet. The closet door is closed. 
	a drawing
	a table. On the table is: nothing.
You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to hallway. Then, I will go to lab. Next, I will look around to find the inclined planes. After that, I will pick up aluminum inclined plane. Then, I will go to bedroom. I will place a white pillow on the aluminum inclined plane. Next, I will use thermometer on white pillow. Then, I will repeat the process with zinc inclined plane. Finally, I will compare the temperatures and focus on the inclined plane with the least friction.
