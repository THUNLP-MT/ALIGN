INFO - Agent Action: put down wood block on inclined plane with aluminum surface
INFO - Observation: The action 'put down wood block on inclined plane with aluminum surface' was not recognized. Please ensure:
1. The action verb (e.g., 'open', 'use', 'go to') and format are correct (refer to the action list).
2. Object/location names are spelled exactly as observed (use 'look around', 'inventory', 'look at', 'look in' to verify).
