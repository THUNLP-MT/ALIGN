INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will find the necessary materials for the life stages of the dove in the art studio or other rooms. Then, I will create or gather representations for each stage: egg, hatchling, fledgling, and adult. Since the task does not specify the use of paints, I will assume the paints are not needed for this task. If I find relevant items, I will use them to represent each stage. If not, I will need to improvise with available objects.
