INFO - ========== Task Name: test-conductivity | Task ID: 27-679 ==========
INFO - Task: This room is called the living room. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a chair. On the chair is: nothing.
	a couch. On the couch is: a white pillow.
	a desk. On the desk is: a drawer.
	a painting
You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the workshop to find the sodium chloride. Then, I will pick up the sodium chloride. Next, I will go to the living room. After that, I will use the thermometer on the sodium chloride to check its temperature. If the temperature changes, it means the sodium chloride is electrically conductive, and I will go to the yellow box to place it there. If the temperature does not change, it means the sodium chloride is electrically nonconductive, and I will go to the purple box to place it there.
INFO - Agent Action: go to hallway
INFO - Observation: You move to the hallway.

INFO - Agent Action: look around
INFO - Observation: This room is called the workshop. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a purple box (containing nothing)
	a red light bulb, which is off
	a substance called sodium chloride
	a table. On the table is: a battery, a black wire, a green light bulb, which is off, a green wire, a orange light bulb, which is off, a orange wire, a switch, which is off, a violet light bulb, which is off.
	a ultra low temperature freezer. The ultra low temperature freezer door is closed.
