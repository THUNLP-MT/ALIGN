INFO - Agent Action: Based on the information available, chameleons, parrots, and rabbits have different life spans. Chameleons typically live 3-8 years, parrots can live up to several decades, and rabbits usually live 2-8 years. Given this, the chameleon egg likely represents the animal with the shortest potential life span compared to the others. Since the task is to focus on the animal with the shortest life span, I will now focus on the chameleon egg.
