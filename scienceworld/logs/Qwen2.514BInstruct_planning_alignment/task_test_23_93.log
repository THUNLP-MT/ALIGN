INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will pick up the seed jar. Then, I will move the round green pea seed from the seed jar to the red box. Next, I will move the wrinkly green pea seed from the seed jar to the green box. Then, I will go to the outside. After that, I will plant the round green pea seed in the soil of flower pot 2. Next, I will plant the wrinkly green pea seed in the soil of flower pot 3. Then, I will go to the sink. After that, I will turn on the sink. Next, I will fill the jug with water from the sink. Then, I will go to the outside. After that, I will pour the water from the jug into the soil of flower pot 2. Next, I will pour the water from the jug into the soil of flower pot 3. Then, I will wait for the plants to grow. After that, I will observe the shape of the seeds produced by the grown plants to determine if the round seed shape is dominant or recessive.
