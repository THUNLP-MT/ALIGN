INFO - Agent Action: wait [until solid unknown substance Y starts melting]

# Observation from the environment
As you wait, the temperature in the kitchen gradually increases. The solid unknown substance Y begins to melt at around 50 degrees celsius.

Your task is to measure the melting point of solid unknown substance Y, which is located around the kitchen. First, focus on the thermometer. Next, focus on the solid unknown substance Y. If the melting point of solid unknown substance Y is above 200.0 degrees celsius, focus on the yellow box. If the melting point of solid unknown substance Y is below 200.0 degrees celsius, focus on the purple box. The boxes are located around the kitchen.

Now you need to give your next action.
