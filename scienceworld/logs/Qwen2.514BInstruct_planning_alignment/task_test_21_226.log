	A door to the outside (that is open)
INFO - Agent Plan: Plan: First, I will go to the kitchen to find the solid unknown substance Y. Then, I will pick up the solid unknown substance Y. Next, I will go back to the foundry. After that, I will use the thermometer on the solid unknown substance Y. If the melting point is above 150.0 degrees celsius, I will focus on the orange box. If it is below 150.0 degrees celsius, I will focus on the yellow box.
INFO - Agent Action: go to kitchen
INFO - Observation: The action 'go to kitchen' was not recognized. This might be because 'kitchen' is not an adjacent location, the name is misspelled, or the location doesn't exist. Movement is restricted to adjacent rooms. Use 'look around' to see available exits and verify location names.
