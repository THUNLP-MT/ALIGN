INFO - Agent Action: put down seed jar
focus on round green pea seed
focus on wrinkly green pea seed

# Reasoning
To determine if the round seed shape is dominant or recessive, I need to observe the traits of the seeds. If the round seed appears with the wrinkly seed, it suggests that the round shape is dominant. Since I have both types of seeds, I can now decide which box to focus on based on the trait dominance.
