INFO - ========== Task Name: inclined-plane-friction-named-surfaces | Task ID: 15-1040 ==========
INFO - Task: This room is called the foundry. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a blast furnace, which is turned off. The blast furnace door is closed. 
	a sink, which is turned off. In the sink is: nothing.
	a table. On the table is: nothing.
You also see:
	A door to the outside (that is open)
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The blast furnace is not relevant to the task, and the sink has no useful items. I should check the table for any inclined planes or materials needed for the experiment.
ACTION: look at table
