INFO - Score: 10
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The unknown substance U is located on the table. I need to pick it up to examine it.
ACTION: pick up unknown substance U
INFO - Agent Action: pick up unknown substance U
INFO - Observation: You move the unknown substance U to the inventory.
INFO - Score: 10
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I need to test the electrical conductivity of the unknown substance U using the wires and switch on the table.
ACTION: use black wire on unknown substance U
INFO - Agent Action: use black wire on unknown substance U
INFO - Observation: I'm not sure how to use the black wire.
INFO - Score: 10
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I need to connect the black wire to the unknown substance U and then to the switch to test its conductivity.
ACTION: connect black wire to unknown substance U
INFO - Agent Action: connect black wire to unknown substance U
INFO - Observation: Connections must specify specific points of contact on unpolarized electrical components (e.g. terminal 1, terminal 2)
INFO - Score: 10
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since the unknown substance U is not a polarized component, I can connect the black wire directly to it.
ACTION: connect black wire to unknown substance U
INFO - Agent Action: connect black wire to unknown substance U
INFO - Observation: Connections must specify specific points of contact on unpolarized electrical components (e.g. terminal 1, terminal 2)
INFO - Score: 10
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I need to specify a point of contact to connect the black wire to the unknown substance U.
ACTION: connect black wire to unknown substance U at terminal 1
INFO - Agent Action: connect black wire to unknown substance U at terminal 1
INFO - Observation: No known action matches that input.
INFO - Score: 10
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I need to connect the black wire to a specific point on the unknown substance U, but I should first ensure I have the correct object specifier.
ACTION: focus on unknown substance U
INFO - Agent Action: focus on unknown substance U
INFO - Observation: You focus on the unknown substance U.
INFO - Score: 60
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Now that I have focused on the unknown substance U, I need to connect the black wire to a specific point on it.
ACTION: connect black wire to unknown substance U at terminal 1
INFO - Agent Action: connect black wire to unknown substance U at terminal 1
INFO - Observation: No known action matches that input.
INFO - Score: 60
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I need to connect the black wire to a specific point on the unknown substance U, but the action format seems incorrect. I will try connecting the wire directly.
