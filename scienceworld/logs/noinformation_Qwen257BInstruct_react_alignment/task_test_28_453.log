INFO - Observation: You move the black wire to the inventory.
INFO - Score: 60
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I now have the black wire in my inventory. Next, I need to connect it to the unknown substance U.
ACTION: use black wire on unknown substance U
INFO - Agent Action: use black wire on unknown substance U
INFO - Observation: I'm not sure how to use the black wire.
INFO - Score: 60
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I need to connect the black wire to the unknown substance U to form a circuit.
ACTION: connect black wire to unknown substance U
INFO - Agent Action: connect black wire to unknown substance U
INFO - Observation: Connections must specify specific points of contact on unpolarized electrical components (e.g. terminal 1, terminal 2)
INFO - Score: 60
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since the unknown substance U is not a polarized component, I can connect the wire directly to it.
ACTION: connect black wire to unknown substance U
