INFO - ========== Task Name: test-conductivity | Task ID: 27-678 ==========
INFO - Task: This room is called the workshop. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a orange box (containing nothing)
	a red light bulb, which is off
	a substance called sodium chloride
	a table. On the table is: a battery, a black wire, a blue light bulb, which is off, a green light bulb, which is off, a green wire, a orange light bulb, which is off, a orange wire, a switch, which is off.
	a ultra low temperature freezer. The ultra low temperature freezer door is closed. 
	a yellow box (containing nothing)
You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Examine the sodium chloride to determine if it is electrically conductive.
ACTION: focus on sodium chloride
INFO - Agent Action: focus on sodium chloride
INFO - Observation: You focus on the sodium chloride.
INFO - Score: 55
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Sodium chloride is a solid crystal, which is typically non-conductive. However, I should verify by attempting to pass an electrical current through it.
ACTION: connect battery to green wire
INFO - Agent Action: connect battery to green wire
INFO - Observation: Connections must specify specific points of contact on polarized electrical components (e.g. anode, cathode)
INFO - Score: 55
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
