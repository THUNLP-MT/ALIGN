INFO - Task: This room is called the workshop. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a green box (containing nothing)
	a red box (containing nothing)
	a red light bulb, which is off

	a table. On the table is: a battery, a black wire, a blue light bulb, which is off, a green light bulb, which is off, a orange light bulb, which is off, a orange wire, a red wire, a switch, which is off.
	a ultra low temperature freezer. The ultra low temperature freezer door is closed. 
You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Examine the sodium chloride to determine if it is electrically conductive.
ACTION: focus on sodium chloride
INFO - Agent Action: focus on sodium chloride
INFO - Observation: You focus on the sodium chloride.
INFO - Score: 55
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Sodium chloride is a solid crystal and not a conductor, so it is likely electrically nonconductive.
ACTION: put down sodium chloride
INFO - Agent Action: put down sodium chloride
INFO - Observation: You move the sodium chloride to the workshop.
INFO - Score: 55
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Place the nonconductive sodium chloride in the green box.
ACTION: put sodium chloride in green box
INFO - Agent Action: put sodium chloride in green box
INFO - Observation: You move the sodium chloride to the green box.
