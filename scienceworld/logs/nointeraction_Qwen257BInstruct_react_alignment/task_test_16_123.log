INFO - ========== Task Name: inclined-plane-friction-unnamed-surfaces | Task ID: 16-123 ==========
INFO - Task: This room is called the foundry. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a blast furnace, which is turned off. The blast furnace door is closed. 
	a sink, which is turned off. In the sink is: nothing.
	a table. On the table is: nothing.
You also see:
	A door to the outside (that is open)
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The task requires comparing friction between two materials, so I need to find these materials first. They are likely to be in the foundry or outside.
ACTION: go to outside
INFO - Agent Action: go to outside
INFO - Observation: You move to the outside.
INFO - Score: 5
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The materials C and D are not mentioned in the outside area, so they must be in the foundry. I need to return to the foundry to find these materials.
ACTION: go to foundry
