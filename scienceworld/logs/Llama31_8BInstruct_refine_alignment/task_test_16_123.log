INFO - Agent Action: go to outside and look for inclined planes
INFO - Observation: You cannot go to 'outside and look for inclined planes'. This might be because:
1. It's not a valid location name, is misspelled, or is not directly accessible from here. Check available exits in the room description.
2. 'outside and look for inclined planes' refers to an object or area within your current location, not a separate navigable location. Use 'look around' to see objects here and interact with them directly.
