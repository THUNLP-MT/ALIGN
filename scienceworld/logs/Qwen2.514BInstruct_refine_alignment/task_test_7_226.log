INFO - Agent Action: go to living room
INFO - Observation: You cannot go to 'living room'. This might be because:
1. It's not a valid location name, is misspelled, or is not directly accessible from here. Check available exits in the room description.
2. 'living room' refers to an object or area within your current location, not a separate navigable location. Use 'look around' to see objects here and interact with them directly.
