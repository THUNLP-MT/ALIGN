task

Based on the task and the available information, the baby elephant likely represents an elephant, which has a longer lifespan compared to the baby beaver and baby ant. The baby ant likely represents an ant, which has a much shorter lifespan. 

Since the environment does not support the 'look at' action for these animals, I will assume the task requires identifying the animals based on the available information. 

Now that I've identified the animals with the longest and shortest lifespans, my next step is to focus on the animal with the longest life span, which is the baby elephant. 

Since there are no further actions to take regarding the baby elephant in this location, I will proceed to the next part of the task once the environment supports it. For now, I will restate the task to confirm my understanding.
