# Observation from the environment
As you wait, you notice that the solid unknown substance S begins to melt at a temperature of 12 degrees celsius.

Your task is to measure the melting point of solid unknown substance S, which is located around the kitchen. First, focus on the thermometer. Next, focus on the solid unknown substance S. If the melting point of solid unknown substance S is above 10.0 degrees celsius, focus on the red box. If the melting point of solid unknown substance S is below 10.0 degrees celsius, focus on the green box. The boxes are located around the kitchen.

Now you need to give your next action.  
ACTION [object/receptacle specifier]
