# Observation from the environment
After waiting for 5 minutes, the temperature inside the ceramic cup has risen to 20 degrees celsius. The tin remains solid.

Your task is to measure the melting point of tin, which is located around the kitchen. First, focus on the thermometer. Next, focus on the tin. If the melting point of tin is above 50.0 degrees celsius, focus on the red box. If the melting point of tin is below 50.0 degrees celsius, focus on the green box. The boxes are located around the kitchen.

Now you need to give your next action. 

Since the temperature is still below the melting point of tin (which is around 232 degrees Celsius), we need to continue heating. Let's use the stove to heat the tin.
