Your task is to grow a orange plant from seed. Seeds can be found in the bathroom. First, focus on a seed. Then, make changes to the environment that grow the plant until it reaches the reproduction life stage.

Now you need to give your next action.

Since the kitchen doesn't seem to have the seeds, I'll try the living room next.
