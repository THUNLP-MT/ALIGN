Since the environment is not recognizing the specific terminal connection, let's try a different approach to test conductivity.

use black wire on unknown substance U
use red light bulb on unknown substance U
use battery on unknown substance U

Given the environment's constraints, let's simplify and directly test conductivity:

place unknown substance U on table
connect black wire to battery
connect black wire to red light bulb
place unknown substance U between black wire and red light bulb
