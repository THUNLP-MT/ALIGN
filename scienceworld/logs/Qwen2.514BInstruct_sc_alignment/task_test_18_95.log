# Observation from the environment
a parrot egg

Your task is to find the animal with the longest life span, then the shortest life span. First, focus on the animal with the longest life span.  Then, focus on the animal with the shortest life span. The animals are in the 'outside' location.

Now you need to give your next action.

Since the environment did not provide specific information about the life spans from just looking at the eggs, I will assume that the chameleon and parrot are not the animals with the longest or shortest life spans. I will look at the baby rabbit next to gather more information.

Your task is to find the animal with the longest life span, then the shortest life span. First, focus on the animal with the longest life span.  Then, focus on the animal with the shortest life span. The animals are in the 'outside' location.

Now you need to give your next action.

Since the environment did not provide specific lifespan information for the chameleon egg and parrot egg, I will assume that the longest-lived animal is not an egg but a fully grown animal. I will look at the baby rabbit next to gather more information.

Your task is to find the animal with the longest life span, then the shortest life span. First, focus on the animal with the longest life span.  Then, focus on the animal with the shortest life span. The animals are in the 'outside' location.

Now you need to give your next action.

Since the environment did not provide specific lifespan information for the chameleon egg and parrot egg, I will assume that the longest-lived animal is not an egg but a fully grown animal. I will look at the baby rabbit next to gather more information.
