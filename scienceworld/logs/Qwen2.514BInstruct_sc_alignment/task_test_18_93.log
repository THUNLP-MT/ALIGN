INFO - Observation: Task description:
Your task is to find the animal with the longest life span, then the shortest life span. First, focus on the animal with the longest life span.  Then, focus on the animal with the shortest life span. The animals are in the 'outside' location.

INFO - Agent Action: focus on crocodile egg

Based on the typical life spans of these animals, the crocodile (from which the crocodile egg will hatch) has a longer life span compared to mice and wolves. Next, I will focus on finding the animal with the shortest life span, which is likely to be the mouse. 

Now, my next action will be to focus on the baby mouse for the shortest life span.
