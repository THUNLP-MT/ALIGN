INFO - Score: 5
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I have found the thermometer, so now I should focus on it as per the task instructions to prepare for measuring the melting point of solid unknown substance S.
ACTION: focus on thermometer
INFO - Agent Action: focus on thermometer
INFO - Observation: You focus on the thermometer.
INFO - Score: 38
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Now that I've focused on the thermometer, the next step is to focus on the solid unknown substance S to proceed with measuring its melting point.
ACTION: focus on solid unknown substance S
INFO - Agent Action: focus on solid unknown substance S
INFO - Observation: You focus on the solid unknown substance S.
INFO - Score: 72
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since I've focused on the solid unknown substance S, I now need to determine its melting point and compare it to 10.0 degrees Celsius to decide which box to focus on next.
ACTION: use thermometer on solid unknown substance S
INFO - Agent Action: use thermometer on solid unknown substance S
INFO - Observation: the thermometer measures a temperature of 10 degrees celsius
INFO - Score: 73
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The thermometer measures a temperature of 10 degrees Celsius, which is exactly 10.0 degrees Celsius, but since the task specifies "above 10.0 degrees Celsius" for the red box, this temperature is not above 10.0, so I should focus on the green box.
ACTION: focus on green box
INFO - Agent Action: focus on green box
INFO - Observation: You focus on the green box.
INFO - Score: -100
INFO - Done: True
