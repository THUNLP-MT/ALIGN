INFO - Score: 4
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: With the door to the outside being open, I can now access the area where the pear plants are located, allowing me to focus on their life stages.
ACTION: go to outside
INFO - Agent Action: go to outside
INFO - Observation: You move to the outside.
INFO - Score: 8
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Now that I'm outside where the pear plants are located, I should examine them to learn about their life stages, starting from the earliest to the latest.
ACTION: look around
INFO - Agent Action: look around
INFO - Observation: This outside location is called the outside. Here you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	an axe

	a self watering flower pot 2 (containing a pear tree in the seedling stage, soil, a substance called water)
	a self watering flower pot 3 (containing a pear seed, soil, a substance called water)
	a self watering flower pot 7 (containing a dead pear tree, soil, a substance called water)
	a self watering flower pot 9 (containing a pear tree in the adult stage, soil)
	a shovel
	a substance called wood
You also see:
	A door to the foundry (that is open)
	A door to the greenhouse (that is open)
	A door to the kitchen (that is open)
INFO - Score: 8
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: To focus on the life stages of the pear plant from earliest to latest, I should start by examining the pear seed, which is likely the earliest stage of development.
ACTION: look at self watering flower pot 3
INFO - Agent Action: look at self watering flower pot 3
INFO - Observation: a self watering flower pot 3 (containing a pear seed, soil, a substance called water)
INFO - Score: 8
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Having observed the pear seed, the next stage in the life cycle would be the seedling stage, so I should examine the self watering flower pot containing a pear tree in the seedling stage.
ACTION: look at self watering flower pot 2
INFO - Agent Action: look at self watering flower pot 2
INFO - Observation: a self watering flower pot 2 (containing a pear tree in the seedling stage, soil, a substance called water)
INFO - Score: 8
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Now that I've observed the seedling stage, the next logical stage in the life cycle of the pear plant would be the adult stage, or possibly a reproducing stage, so I should examine the self watering flower pot containing a pear tree in the adult or reproducing stage.
ACTION: look at self watering flower pot 1
INFO - Agent Action: look at self watering flower pot 1
INFO - Observation: a self watering flower pot 1 (containing a pear tree in the reproducing stage. On the pear tree you see: a flower. , soil)
INFO - Score: 12
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Having observed the seed, seedling, and reproducing stages, I should also examine the adult stage to ensure I've covered all life stages, so I'll look at the self watering flower pot containing a pear tree in the adult stage.
ACTION: look at self watering flower pot 9
INFO - Agent Action: look at self watering flower pot 9
INFO - Observation: a self watering flower pot 9 (containing a pear tree in the reproducing stage, soil)
INFO - Score: 12
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: It seems I've observed the seed, seedling, and reproducing stages, but the observation of the adult stage was actually another reproducing stage, so I need to re-evaluate if I've truly seen all stages, including a distinct adult stage before reproducing.
ACTION: look at self watering flower pot 9 again
INFO - Agent Action: look at self watering flower pot 9 again
INFO - Observation: No known action matches that input.
INFO - Score: 12
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since I've already examined the available pots and found the seed, seedling, and reproducing stages, but not a clear adult stage separate from reproducing, I should consider if the reproducing stage implies the plant has reached adulthood, thus covering the life stages.
ACTION: focus on self watering flower pot 3
INFO - Agent Action: focus on self watering flower pot 3
INFO - Observation: You focus on the self watering flower pot 3.
INFO - Score: -100
INFO - Done: True
