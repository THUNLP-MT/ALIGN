INFO - ========== Task Name: mendelian-genetics-known-plant | Task ID: 23-90 ==========
INFO - Task: This room is called the bedroom. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a bed. On the bed is: a mattress. On the mattress is: a white pillow..
	a book shelf (containing A book (Moby Dick) titled Moby Dick by Herman Melville, A book (Pride and Prejudice) titled Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen)
	a closet. The closet door is closed. 
	a painting
	a table. On the table is: nothing.
You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I need to find information about the pea plant and its traits, but the current room, the bedroom, does not seem to have any relevant resources, so I should look for a way to access other parts of the house or find a book that might help.
ACTION: look at book shelf
INFO - Agent Action: look at book shelf
INFO - Observation: a book shelf (containing A book (Moby Dick) titled Moby Dick by Herman Melville, A book (Pride and Prejudice) titled Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen)
INFO - Score: 0
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The books on the shelf, Moby Dick and Pride and Prejudice, are literary classics and unlikely to contain information about pea plant genetics, so I should consider other options in the room or leave the room to find more relevant resources.
ACTION: go to hallway
INFO - Agent Action: go to hallway
INFO - Observation: You move to the hallway.
INFO - Score: 1
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since I'm now in the hallway, I should look around to see if there are any rooms or objects that could provide information about genetics or pea plants, such as a study, library, or laboratory.
ACTION: look around
INFO - Agent Action: look around
INFO - Observation: This room is called the hallway. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a drawing
You also see:
	A door to the art studio (that is open)
	A door to the bedroom (that is open)
	A door to the greenhouse (that is open)
	A door to the kitchen (that is open)
	A door to the living room (that is open)
	A door to the workshop (that is open)
INFO - Score: 1
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The greenhouse is the most likely place to find information about plants, including pea plants, and their genetic traits, so I should go there to see if I can find any relevant resources or experiments.
ACTION: go to greenhouse
INFO - Agent Action: go to greenhouse
INFO - Observation: You move to the greenhouse.
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Now that I'm in the greenhouse, I should look around for any plants, notes, or equipment that could provide information about pea plant genetics, such as a journal or a diagram explaining the traits of pea plants.
ACTION: look around
INFO - Agent Action: look around
INFO - Observation: This room is called the greenhouse. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a bee hive. The bee hive door is closed. 
	a flower pot 1 (containing soil, a substance called water)
	a flower pot 4 (containing soil, a substance called water)
	a flower pot 5 (containing soil, a substance called water)
	a flower pot 7 (containing soil, a substance called water)
	a flower pot 8 (containing soil, a substance called water)
	a flower pot 9 (containing soil, a substance called water)
	a green box (containing nothing)
	a jug (containing nothing)
	a red box (containing nothing)
	a seed jar (containing a wrinkly green pea seed, a round green pea seed)
	a shovel
	a sink, which is turned off. In the sink is: nothing.
You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
	A door to the outside (that is open)
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The seed jar contains both a wrinkly green pea seed and a round green pea seed, which suggests that the greenhouse may be used for experimenting with pea plant traits, and I should examine the seeds or the jar more closely to see if there are any notes or labels that could provide information about the genetics of the seeds.
ACTION: look at seed jar
INFO - Agent Action: look at seed jar
INFO - Observation: a seed jar (containing a wrinkly green pea seed, a round green pea seed)
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since the seed jar contains both a wrinkly and a round pea seed, and I'm trying to determine whether round seed shape is dominant or recessive, I should recall that in Mendelian genetics, round seed shape is typically a dominant trait, so I should focus on the red box if this principle applies.
ACTION: focus on red box
INFO - Agent Action: focus on red box
INFO - Observation: You focus on the red box.
INFO - Score: 100
INFO - Done: True
