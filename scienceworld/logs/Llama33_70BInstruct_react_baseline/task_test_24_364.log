INFO - Agent Action: go to greenhouse
INFO - Observation: You move to the greenhouse.
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------

	A door to the outside (that is open)
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The seed jar contains both spherical and ovate unknown D seeds, which suggests that the plant may exhibit both traits, so I should examine the seeds or the jar more closely to gather more information.
ACTION: look at seed jar
INFO - Agent Action: look at seed jar
INFO - Observation: a seed jar (containing a spherical unknown D seed, a ovate unknown D seed)
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since the seed jar contains both spherical and ovate seeds, it's possible that the plant is a hybrid, and I need to find more information about the parent plants or the genetic makeup of the unknown D plant to determine the dominance of the spherical seed shape trait.
ACTION: look at flower pot 2
INFO - Agent Action: look at flower pot 2
INFO - Observation: a flower pot 2 (containing soil, a substance called water)
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The flower pot 2 doesn't seem to provide any direct information about the unknown D plant's traits, so I should try to find a note, book, or other source of information that could help me understand the genetics of the plant.
ACTION: go to living room
INFO - Agent Action: go to living room
INFO - Observation: No known action matches that input.
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: It seems I need to use the "go to LOC" action with a specific location, so I should try going to a different room that might have relevant information, such as the workshop or the art studio.
ACTION: go to workshop
INFO - Agent Action: go to workshop
INFO - Observation: No known action matches that input.
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I should use the exact door name as the location, so I will try going to the "hallway" and then to another room from there, or examine the current room more closely for any clues.
ACTION: go to hallway
INFO - Agent Action: go to hallway
INFO - Observation: You move to the hallway.
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------

ACTION: go to art studio
INFO - Agent Action: go to art studio
INFO - Observation: You move to the art studio.
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I should examine the art studio to see if there are any notes, books, or other objects that could provide information about the genetics of the unknown D plant or the dominance of the spherical seed shape trait.
ACTION: look around
INFO - Agent Action: look around
INFO - Observation: This room is called the art studio. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a large cupboard. The large cupboard door is closed.

	A door to the hallway (that is open)
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The art studio doesn't seem to have any obvious information about the unknown D plant, but the large cupboard might contain something useful, so I should try to open it and see what's inside.
ACTION: open large cupboard
INFO - Agent Action: open large cupboard
INFO - Observation: The large cupboard is now open.
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Now that the large cupboard is open, I should examine its contents to see if there are any notes, books, or other objects that could provide information about the genetics of the unknown D plant or the dominance of the spherical seed shape trait.
ACTION: look in large cupboard
INFO - Agent Action: look in large cupboard
INFO - Observation: Inside the large cupboard is: 
	a drawer
	a wood cup (containing red paint)
	a wood cup (containing blue paint)
	a wood cup (containing yellow paint)
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------

INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Now that the drawer is open, I should examine its contents to see if there are any notes, documents, or other objects that could provide information about the genetics of the unknown D plant or the dominance of the spherical seed shape trait.
ACTION: look in drawer
INFO - Agent Action: look in drawer
INFO - Observation: Inside the drawer is: 
	nothing
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The drawer is empty, so I should go back to the greenhouse where I found the seed jar with the unknown D plant seeds and think about what I can do with the information I have so far.
ACTION: go to greenhouse
INFO - Agent Action: go to greenhouse
INFO - Observation: No known action matches that input.
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I need to use the correct syntax to go to the greenhouse, which is to use the "go to" action followed by the exact name of the location, so I should try again.
ACTION: go to hallway
INFO - Agent Action: go to hallway
INFO - Observation: You move to the hallway.
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Now that I'm in the hallway, I can go to the greenhouse by using the correct syntax, so I'll try again to get back to the room where I found the seed jar.
ACTION: go to greenhouse
INFO - Agent Action: go to greenhouse
INFO - Observation: You move to the greenhouse.
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I'm back in the greenhouse where I found the seed jar with both spherical and ovate unknown D seeds, and since I haven't found any explicit information about the trait's dominance, I should make an educated guess based on the available seeds.
ACTION: focus on green box
INFO - Agent Action: focus on green box
INFO - Observation: You focus on the green box.
