INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The presence of both ovate and spherical seeds in the seed jar suggests that the unknown D plant may exhibit both traits, so I should examine the seeds more closely to determine the relationship between the traits.
ACTION: look at seed jar
INFO - Agent Action: look at seed jar
INFO - Observation: a seed jar (containing a ovate unknown D seed, a spherical unknown D seed)
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since the seed jar contains both an ovate and a spherical seed, it's likely that the spherical seed shape is dominant if it's present alongside a recessive ovate shape, so I should focus on the green box.
