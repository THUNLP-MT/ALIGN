ACTION: focus on thermometer
INFO - Agent Action: focus on thermometer
INFO - Observation: You focus on the thermometer.
INFO - Score: 39
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I've focused on the thermometer, so now I should focus on the tin to proceed with measuring its melting point.
ACTION: focus on tin
INFO - Agent Action: focus on tin
INFO - Observation: You focus on the tin.
INFO - Score: 73
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since I've focused on the tin, I now need to determine its melting point to decide whether to focus on the red or green box.
ACTION: use thermometer on tin
INFO - Agent Action: use thermometer on tin
INFO - Observation: the thermometer measures a temperature of 10 degrees celsius
INFO - Score: 74
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The measured temperature of 10 degrees celsius is not the melting point of tin, but rather the current temperature, so I need to heat the tin to find its melting point.
ACTION: use stove on tin
INFO - Agent Action: use stove on tin
INFO - Observation: I'm not sure how to use the stove.
INFO - Score: 74
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------

INFO - Agent Action: activate stove
INFO - Observation: The stove is now activated.
INFO - Score: 75
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: With the stove activated, I can now use it to heat the tin and measure its melting point using the thermometer.
ACTION: use stove on tin
INFO - Agent Action: use stove on tin
INFO - Observation: I'm not sure how to use the stove.
INFO - Score: 75
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since I still don't know how to use the stove, I should look around the kitchen to see if there are any other ways to heat the tin or any clues on how to use the stove.
ACTION: look around
INFO - Agent Action: look around

	a stopwatch, which is deactivated. 
	a stove, which is turned on. On the stove is: nothing.
	a table. On the table is: a glass cup (containing nothing).
	a thermometer, currently reading a temperature of 10 degrees celsius
You also see:
	A door to the bathroom (that is open)
	A door to the hallway (that is open)

INFO - Score: 75
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I see a lighter in the kitchen, which could be used to heat the tin, providing an alternative to using the stove.
ACTION: use lighter on tin
INFO - Agent Action: use lighter on tin
INFO - Observation: The lighter heats up the tin a small amount.
INFO - Score: 75
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The lighter has heated the tin, but I still need to measure its temperature to determine the melting point, so I should use the thermometer on the tin again.
ACTION: use thermometer on tin
INFO - Agent Action: use thermometer on tin
INFO - Observation: the thermometer measures a temperature of 20 degrees celsius
INFO - Score: 75
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The temperature of the tin is still below its melting point, so I should continue heating it using the lighter until it reaches or exceeds its melting point.
ACTION: use lighter on tin
INFO - Agent Action: use lighter on tin
INFO - Observation: The lighter heats up the tin a small amount.
INFO - Score: 75
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I need to check the temperature of the tin again to see if it has reached its melting point, so I should use the thermometer on the tin.
ACTION: use thermometer on tin
INFO - Agent Action: use thermometer on tin
INFO - Observation: the thermometer measures a temperature of 30 degrees celsius
INFO - Score: 75
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The tin's temperature is still rising but has not yet reached its melting point, so I should continue heating it using the lighter.
ACTION: use lighter on tin
INFO - Agent Action: use lighter on tin
INFO - Observation: The lighter heats up the tin a small amount.
INFO - Score: 76
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I should check the temperature of the tin again to see if it has reached or exceeded its melting point, so I'll use the thermometer on the tin.

INFO - Agent Action: use thermometer on tin
INFO - Observation: the thermometer measures a temperature of 40 degrees celsius
INFO - Score: 77
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The tin's temperature is still rising but has not yet reached its melting point, so I should continue heating it using the lighter.

INFO - Agent Action: use thermometer on tin
INFO - Observation: the thermometer measures a temperature of 50 degrees celsius
INFO - Score: 77
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The tin's temperature has reached 50 degrees celsius, and since the melting point of tin is typically around 231 degrees celsius, it is above 50.0 degrees celsius, so I should focus on the red box.
