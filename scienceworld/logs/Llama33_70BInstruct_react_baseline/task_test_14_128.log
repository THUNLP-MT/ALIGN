	a desk. On the desk is: a drawer.
	a painting
You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I need to locate the inclined planes B and H to compare their angles, but first, I should look around the living room to see if they are present.
ACTION: look around
INFO - Agent Action: look around
INFO - Observation: This room is called the living room. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a book shelf (containing nothing)

	a painting
You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
INFO - Score: 0
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The inclined planes B and H are not visible in the living room, so I need to explore other areas of the house to find them.
ACTION: go to hallway
INFO - Agent Action: go to hallway
INFO - Observation: You move to the hallway.
INFO - Score: 5
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since I've moved to the hallway, I should look around to see if the inclined planes B and H are present in this area.
ACTION: look around
INFO - Agent Action: look around
INFO - Observation: This room is called the hallway. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a painting
You also see:
	A door to the art studio (that is open)
	A door to the bedroom (that is open)
	A door to the greenhouse (that is open)
	A door to the kitchen (that is open)
	A door to the living room (that is open)
	A door to the workshop (that is open)
INFO - Score: 5
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The inclined planes B and H are still not visible, so I should try exploring one of the open doors to see if they are located in another room, and the workshop seems like a plausible place to find them.
ACTION: go to workshop
INFO - Agent Action: go to workshop
INFO - Observation: You move to the workshop.
INFO - Score: 10
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Now that I'm in the workshop, I should look around to see if the inclined planes B and H are present and can be compared.
ACTION: look around
INFO - Agent Action: look around
INFO - Observation: This room is called the workshop. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a brick
	an inclined plane H
	an inclined plane B
	a stopwatch, which is deactivated. 
	a table. On the table is: a battery, a black wire, a blue light bulb, which is off, a green wire, a orange light bulb, which is off, a switch, which is off, a yellow light bulb, which is off, a yellow wire.

You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
INFO - Score: 10
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I've found the inclined planes B and H, and to compare their angles, I should examine each one individually to determine their steepness.
ACTION: look at inclined plane B
INFO - Agent Action: look at inclined plane B
INFO - Observation: an inclined plane B
INFO - Score: 10
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Now that I've examined inclined plane B, I should also examine inclined plane H to compare their angles and determine which one is shallower.
ACTION: look at inclined plane H
INFO - Agent Action: look at inclined plane H
INFO - Observation: an inclined plane H
INFO - Score: 10
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Having examined both inclined planes B and H, I can now compare their angles and determine which one has the shallowest angle.
ACTION: focus on inclined plane B
INFO - Agent Action: focus on inclined plane B
INFO - Observation: You focus on the inclined plane B.
INFO - Score: -100
INFO - Done: True
