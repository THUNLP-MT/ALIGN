INFO - Score: 10
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I've found the mercury in the paper cup on the table, so now I should focus on it and prepare it for the freezing process, which likely involves using the ultra low temperature freezer.
ACTION: focus on mercury
INFO - Agent Action: focus on mercury
INFO - Observation: You focus on the mercury.
INFO - Score: 77
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Now that I'm focused on the mercury, I need to get it into the ultra low temperature freezer to change its state of matter from liquid to solid.
ACTION: open ultra low temperature freezer
INFO - Agent Action: open ultra low temperature freezer
INFO - Observation: The ultra low temperature freezer is now open.
INFO - Score: 77
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: With the ultra low temperature freezer open, I should now move the mercury from the paper cup into the freezer to initiate the freezing process.
ACTION: move paper cup to ultra low temperature freezer
INFO - Agent Action: move paper cup to ultra low temperature freezer
INFO - Observation: You move the paper cup to the ultra low temperature freezer.
INFO - Score: 77
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The mercury is now inside the ultra low temperature freezer, so the next step is to close the freezer door to initiate the freezing process.
ACTION: close ultra low temperature freezer
INFO - Agent Action: close ultra low temperature freezer
INFO - Observation: The ultra low temperature freezer is now closed.
INFO - Score: 77
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: With the mercury inside and the ultra low temperature freezer closed, I should activate the freezer to start the cooling process that will freeze the mercury.
ACTION: activate ultra low temperature freezer
INFO - Agent Action: activate ultra low temperature freezer
INFO - Observation: The ultra low temperature freezer is already activated.
INFO - Score: 77
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------

ACTION: wait
INFO - Agent Action: wait
INFO - Observation: You decide to wait for 10 iterations.
INFO - Score: 82
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: After waiting, I should check if the mercury has frozen by examining the contents of the ultra low temperature freezer.

	a paper cup (containing a substance called mercury)
INFO - Score: 82
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The observation doesn't explicitly state that the mercury has frozen, but given that it's been in the ultra low temperature freezer for a while, I should check the state of the mercury more closely to confirm if it has indeed frozen.
ACTION: look at mercury
INFO - Agent Action: look at mercury
INFO - Observation: a substance called mercury
INFO - Score: 82
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
