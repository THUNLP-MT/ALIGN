INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I have identified the animals in the outside location as a baby mouse and a baby wolf, and I also see a crocodile egg, which will eventually become an animal, so I need to consider the typical life spans of these animals to determine which one has the longest life span.
ACTION: look at baby wolf
INFO - Agent Action: look at baby wolf
INFO - Observation: a baby wolf
INFO - Score: 33
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since I've looked at the baby wolf, I should now compare the life spans of the animals present, and considering that crocodiles are known to live a long time, up to 70 years or more in some cases, I should examine the crocodile egg to determine if it could be the animal with the longest life span.
ACTION: look at crocodile egg
INFO - Agent Action: look at crocodile egg
INFO - Observation: a crocodile egg
INFO - Score: 33
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Having observed the crocodile egg, I can conclude that a crocodile, which will hatch from this egg, is likely to have the longest life span among the animals present, so now I should focus on finding the animal with the shortest life span.
ACTION: look at baby mouse
INFO - Agent Action: look at baby mouse
INFO - Observation: a baby mouse
INFO - Score: 33
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I have now observed the baby mouse, and considering that mice have relatively short life spans, typically ranging from 1 to 3 years, I can conclude that the baby mouse is likely to have the shortest life span among the animals present.
ACTION: focus on baby mouse
INFO - Agent Action: focus on baby mouse
INFO - Observation: You focus on the baby mouse.
