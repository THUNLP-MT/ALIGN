INFO - Score: 50
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I have identified the animals in the outside location as a baby mouse and a baby wolf, and I need to determine which one has the longest life span, but since they are both babies, I should also consider the crocodile egg as it may hatch into an animal with a long life span.
ACTION: look at baby mouse
INFO - Agent Action: look at baby mouse
INFO - Observation: a baby mouse
INFO - Score: 50
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The baby mouse is one of the animals, but mice typically have a relatively short life span, so I should compare it with the baby wolf and consider the potential life span of a crocodile that could hatch from the egg.
ACTION: look at baby wolf
INFO - Agent Action: look at baby wolf
INFO - Observation: a baby wolf
INFO - Score: 50
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Wolves can live longer than mice, but I still need to consider the potential life span of a crocodile, which is known to be one of the longest-living animals, to determine which one has the longest life span.
ACTION: look at crocodile egg
INFO - Agent Action: look at crocodile egg
INFO - Observation: a crocodile egg
INFO - Score: 50
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Considering the typical life spans of mice, wolves, and crocodiles, crocodiles are known to live a significantly long time, often up to 70 years or more in the wild, making the crocodile that could hatch from this egg likely to have the longest life span.
ACTION: focus on crocodile egg
INFO - Agent Action: focus on crocodile egg
INFO - Observation: You focus on the crocodile egg.
INFO - Score: 100
