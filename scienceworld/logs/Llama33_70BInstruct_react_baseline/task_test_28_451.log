You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
INFO - Score: 10
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I have found the unknown substance U in the workshop, and to determine its electrical conductivity, I should use the available electrical components, such as the battery and wires, to test it.
ACTION: focus on unknown substance U
INFO - Agent Action: focus on unknown substance U
INFO - Observation: You focus on the unknown substance U.
INFO - Score: 60
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Now that I'm focused on the unknown substance U, I should try to create a circuit using the battery and wires to see if electricity flows through it, which would indicate conductivity.
ACTION: connect battery to green wire
INFO - Agent Action: connect battery to green wire
INFO - Observation: Connections must specify specific points of contact on polarized electrical components (e.g. anode, cathode)
INFO - Score: 60
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: To create a proper connection, I need to specify the points of contact on the polarized electrical components, such as the anode and cathode of the battery.
ACTION: connect battery anode to green wire
INFO - Agent Action: connect battery anode to green wire
INFO - Observation: Connections must specify specific points of contact on unpolarized electrical components (e.g. terminal 1, terminal 2)
INFO - Score: 60
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since the green wire is an unpolarized electrical component, I need to specify the points of contact, such as terminal 1 and terminal 2, to create a connection.
ACTION: connect battery anode to green wire terminal 1
INFO - Agent Action: connect battery anode to green wire terminal 1
INFO - Observation: anode on battery is now connected to terminal 1 on green wire
INFO - Score: 60
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Now that one end of the green wire is connected to the battery, I need to connect the other end of the wire to the unknown substance U to test its conductivity.
ACTION: connect green wire terminal 2 to unknown substance U
INFO - Agent Action: connect green wire terminal 2 to unknown substance U
INFO - Observation: terminal 2 on green wire is now connected to terminal 1 on unknown substance U
INFO - Score: 69
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: To complete the circuit and test the conductivity of the unknown substance U, I need to connect the other terminal of the unknown substance U to the cathode of the battery.
ACTION: connect unknown substance U terminal 2 to battery cathode
INFO - Agent Action: connect unknown substance U terminal 2 to battery cathode
INFO - Observation: terminal 2 on unknown substance U is now connected to cathode on battery
INFO - Score: 69
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The circuit is now complete, and I can observe if the unknown substance U allows electricity to flow through it, but I also need to activate the battery to test the conductivity.
ACTION: activate battery
INFO - Agent Action: activate battery
INFO - Observation: The battery is not something that can be activated.
INFO - Score: 69
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since the battery is already providing power, I can use the switch on the table to control the flow of electricity and test the conductivity of the unknown substance U.
ACTION: activate switch
INFO - Agent Action: activate switch
INFO - Observation: The switch is now activated.
INFO - Score: 69
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: With the switch activated, I should observe the behavior of the circuit, such as the lighting of the light bulbs, to determine if the unknown substance U is electrically conductive.
ACTION: look around
INFO - Agent Action: look around
INFO - Observation: This room is called the workshop. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a blue box (containing nothing)
	a green box (containing nothing)
	a red light bulb, which is off
	a table. On the table is: a battery, a blue light bulb, which is off, a blue wire, a green wire, a orange light bulb, which is off, a red wire, a switch, which is on, a violet light bulb, which is off.
	a ultra low temperature freezer. The ultra low temperature freezer door is closed. 
	unknown substance U
You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
INFO - Score: 69
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since none of the light bulbs are on, it suggests that the unknown substance U may be electrically nonconductive, blocking the flow of electricity in the circuit.
ACTION: disconnect unknown substance U from green wire
INFO - Agent Action: disconnect unknown substance U from green wire
INFO - Observation: No known action matches that input.
INFO - Score: 69
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I need to disconnect the unknown substance U from the circuit, so I should disconnect it from the battery or the wire, and the correct action would be to disconnect the specific connection I made earlier.
ACTION: disconnect terminal 2 on unknown substance U from cathode on battery
INFO - Agent Action: disconnect terminal 2 on unknown substance U from cathode on battery
INFO - Observation: No known action matches that input.
INFO - Score: 69
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since the unknown substance U is not conducting electricity, as indicated by the lack of light from the bulbs, I should place it in the blue box, which is designated for nonconductive materials.
ACTION: move unknown substance U to blue box
INFO - Agent Action: move unknown substance U to blue box
INFO - Observation: (disconnecting unknown substance U)You move the unknown substance U to the blue box.
