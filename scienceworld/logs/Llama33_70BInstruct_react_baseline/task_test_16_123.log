INFO - Score: 5
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The inclined planes are likely to be in a location with equipment or tools for experiments, so the workshop seems like the most promising destination to find them.
ACTION: go to workshop
INFO - Agent Action: go to workshop
INFO - Observation: You move to the workshop.
INFO - Score: 10
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I should examine the workshop to see if the inclined planes are here, and if so, assess their properties and prepare to conduct an experiment to compare their friction.
ACTION: look around
INFO - Agent Action: look around
INFO - Observation: This room is called the workshop. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	an inclined plane with a unknown material D surface
	an inclined plane with a unknown material C surface
	a stopwatch, which is deactivated. 
	a table. On the table is: a battery, a blue wire, a green light bulb, which is off, a green wire, a orange light bulb, which is off, a orange wire, a switch, which is off, a yellow light bulb, which is off.
	a ultra low temperature freezer. The ultra low temperature freezer door is closed. 
	a wood block
You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
INFO - Score: 10
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The inclined planes are now visible, and to compare their friction, I can use the wood block to conduct a simple experiment, but first, I need to prepare the block and the planes for the test.
ACTION: pick up wood block
INFO - Agent Action: pick up wood block
INFO - Observation: You move the wood block to the inventory.
INFO - Score: 10
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: With the wood block in my inventory, I can now use it to test the friction on each inclined plane by releasing it from the top of each plane and observing or measuring its motion.
ACTION: put down wood block on inclined plane with unknown material C surface
INFO - Agent Action: put down wood block on inclined plane with unknown material C surface
INFO - Observation: No known action matches that input.
INFO - Score: 10
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I need to release the wood block from the top of each inclined plane to test the friction, but the action was not recognized, so I should try a different action to place the wood block on the inclined plane.
ACTION: move wood block to inclined plane with unknown material C surface
INFO - Agent Action: move wood block to inclined plane with unknown material C surface
INFO - Observation: You move the wood block to the inclined plane.
INFO - Score: 15
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The wood block is now on the inclined plane with unknown material C, and to compare friction, I should observe or measure how it moves down this plane and then repeat the process on the inclined plane with unknown material D.
ACTION: look at inclined plane with unknown material C surface
INFO - Agent Action: look at inclined plane with unknown material C surface
INFO - Observation: an inclined plane with a unknown material C surface, with: a wood block approximately 4% down the plane
INFO - Score: 15
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The wood block has moved 4% down the inclined plane with unknown material C, providing some information about its friction, and now I should repeat the experiment on the inclined plane with unknown material D to compare.
ACTION: move wood block to inclined plane with unknown material D surface
INFO - Agent Action: move wood block to inclined plane with unknown material D surface
INFO - Observation: You move the wood block to the inclined plane.
INFO - Score: 20
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The wood block is now on the inclined plane with unknown material D, and I should observe how far it moves down this plane to compare with the 4% movement on the inclined plane with unknown material C.
ACTION: look at inclined plane with unknown material D surface
INFO - Agent Action: look at inclined plane with unknown material D surface
INFO - Observation: an inclined plane with a unknown material D surface, with: a wood block approximately 3% down the plane
INFO - Score: 20
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The wood block moved 3% down the inclined plane with unknown material D, which is less than the 4% movement on the inclined plane with unknown material C, indicating that unknown material D has the least friction.
ACTION: focus on inclined plane with unknown material D surface
INFO - Agent Action: focus on inclined plane with unknown material D surface
INFO - Observation: You focus on the inclined plane with a unknown material D surface.
INFO - Score: -100
