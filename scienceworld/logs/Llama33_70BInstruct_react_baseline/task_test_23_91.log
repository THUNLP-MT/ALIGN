INFO - ========== Task Name: mendelian-genetics-known-plant | Task ID: 23-91 ==========
INFO - Task: This room is called the bedroom. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a bed. On the bed is: a mattress. On the mattress is: a white pillow..
	a closet. The closet door is closed. 
	a picture
	a table. On the table is: nothing.
You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I need to find information about the pea plant and its traits, but the current room, the bedroom, does not seem to have any relevant resources or objects that could provide this information.
ACTION: go to hallway
INFO - Agent Action: go to hallway
INFO - Observation: You move to the hallway.
INFO - Score: 1
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since I'm now in the hallway, I should look around to see if there are any rooms or objects that could provide information about pea plants or genetics.
ACTION: look around
INFO - Agent Action: look around
INFO - Observation: This room is called the hallway. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a painting
You also see:
	A door to the art studio (that is open)
	A door to the bedroom (that is open)
	A door to the greenhouse (that is open)
	A door to the kitchen (that is open)
	A door to the living room (that is open)
	A door to the workshop (that is open)
INFO - Score: 1
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The greenhouse seems like the most relevant location to find information about plants, so I should go there to see if I can find any clues about pea plant traits.
ACTION: go to greenhouse
INFO - Agent Action: go to greenhouse
INFO - Observation: You move to the greenhouse.
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Now that I'm in the greenhouse, I should look around to see if there are any pea plants, books, or notes that could provide information about the genetics of round seed shape.
ACTION: look around
INFO - Agent Action: look around
INFO - Observation: This room is called the greenhouse. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a bee hive. The bee hive door is closed. 
	a blue box (containing nothing)
	a flower pot 1 (containing soil, a substance called water)
	a flower pot 2 (containing soil, a substance called water)
	a flower pot 4 (containing soil, a substance called water)
	a flower pot 5 (containing soil, a substance called water)
	a flower pot 7 (containing soil, a substance called water)
	a flower pot 8 (containing soil, a substance called water)
	a green box (containing nothing)
	a jug (containing nothing)
	a seed jar (containing a round green pea seed, a wrinkly orange pea seed)
	a shovel
	a sink, which is turned off. In the sink is: nothing.
You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
	A door to the outside (that is open)
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The seed jar contains both a round green pea seed and a wrinkly orange pea seed, which suggests that the greenhouse may have resources related to pea plant genetics, and I should examine the seeds or the jar more closely.
ACTION: look at seed jar
INFO - Agent Action: look at seed jar
INFO - Observation: a seed jar (containing a round green pea seed, a wrinkly orange pea seed)
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The presence of both round and wrinkly seeds in the jar suggests a genetic variation, and in Mendelian genetics, round seed shape is typically a dominant trait, so I should focus on the green box.
ACTION: focus on green box
INFO - Agent Action: focus on green box
INFO - Observation: You focus on the green box.
INFO - Score: 100
INFO - Done: True
