INFO - ========== Task Name: mendelian-genetics-unknown-plant | Task ID: 24-360 ==========
INFO - Task: This room is called the living room. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a book shelf (containing A book (Sherlock Holmes) titled Sherlock Holmes by Arthur Conan Doyle)

	a finger painting
	a table. On the table is: nothing.
You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I need to find more information about the D plant and its traits, but currently, I'm in a living room with no obvious connection to the D plant, so I should look for a way to access more relevant areas or objects.
ACTION: go to hallway
INFO - Agent Action: go to hallway
INFO - Observation: You move to the hallway.
INFO - Score: 1
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since I'm now in the hallway, I should explore the surrounding area to find any rooms or objects that could provide information about the D plant or genetics.
ACTION: look around
INFO - Agent Action: look around
INFO - Observation: This room is called the hallway. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a drawing
You also see:
	A door to the art studio (that is open)
	A door to the bedroom (that is open)
	A door to the greenhouse (that is open)
	A door to the kitchen (that is open)
	A door to the living room (that is open)
	A door to the workshop (that is open)
INFO - Score: 1
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The greenhouse seems like the most relevant location to find information about plants, so I should head there to see if I can find any clues about the D plant or its traits.
ACTION: go to greenhouse
INFO - Agent Action: go to greenhouse
INFO - Observation: You move to the greenhouse.
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Now that I'm in the greenhouse, I should look around to see if there are any plants, notes, or other objects that could provide information about the D plant and its seed shape trait.
ACTION: look around
INFO - Agent Action: look around
INFO - Observation: This room is called the greenhouse. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a bee hive. The bee hive door is closed. 
	a flower pot 1 (containing soil, a substance called water)
	a flower pot 3 (containing soil, a substance called water)
	a flower pot 4 (containing soil, a substance called water)
	a flower pot 7 (containing soil, a substance called water)
	a flower pot 8 (containing soil, a substance called water)
	a flower pot 9 (containing soil, a substance called water)
	a green box (containing nothing)
	a jug (containing nothing)
	a red box (containing nothing)
	a seed jar (containing a spherical unknown D seed, a ovate unknown D seed)
	a shovel
	a sink, which is turned off. In the sink is: nothing.
You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
	A door to the outside (that is open)
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The presence of both spherical and ovate seeds in the seed jar suggests that the D plant may exhibit both traits, so I should examine the seeds or the jar more closely to see if there are any clues about the genetics of the plant.
ACTION: look at seed jar
INFO - Agent Action: look at seed jar
INFO - Observation: a seed jar (containing a spherical unknown D seed, a ovate unknown D seed)
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since the seed jar contains both a spherical and an ovate seed, it's possible that the plant is a hybrid, and the spherical shape could be dominant if it's the more common or visible trait in the hybrid, so I should focus on the red box.
ACTION: focus on red box
INFO - Agent Action: focus on red box
INFO - Observation: You focus on the red box.
INFO - Score: 100
INFO - Done: True
