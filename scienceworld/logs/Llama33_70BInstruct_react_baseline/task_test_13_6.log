INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Having seen the adult stage, I notice there's also a reproducing stage mentioned in self watering flower pot 3, which seems to be a stage that comes after the adult stage or is closely related to it, so I should examine that next.
ACTION: look at self watering flower pot 3
INFO - Agent Action: look at self watering flower pot 3
INFO - Observation: a self watering flower pot 3 (containing a lemon tree in the reproducing stage, soil)
INFO - Score: 12
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: I have now observed all the stages from seed to adult to reproducing, and since the task is to focus on these stages from earliest to latest, I can consider my observation of the life stages of the lemon plant complete.
ACTION: focus on lemon plant life stages
INFO - Agent Action: focus on lemon plant life stages
INFO - Observation: No known action matches that input.
INFO - Score: 12
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since I've completed observing the life stages of the lemon plant from seed to reproducing and the task is to focus on these stages, I should now signal the completion of my task by focusing on the life stages of the lemon plant.
ACTION: focus on the life stages of the lemon plant
INFO - Agent Action: focus on the life stages of the lemon plant
INFO - Observation: No known action matches that input.
INFO - Score: 12
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The action to focus on the life stages of the lemon plant is not recognized, so I should use the "focus on" action with a more specific object, such as the lemon seed, seedling, adult, or reproducing plant.
ACTION: focus on self watering flower pot 4
INFO - Agent Action: focus on self watering flower pot 4
