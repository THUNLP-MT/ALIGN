ACTION: connect black wire to battery
INFO - Agent Action: connect black wire to battery
INFO - Observation: Connections must specify specific points of contact on unpolarized electrical components (e.g. terminal 1, terminal 2)
INFO - Score: 60
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
