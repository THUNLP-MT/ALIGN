	A door to the kitchen (that is open)
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The current environment is a bathroom, which doesn't seem to have any direct relation to pea plants or genetics, so I need to explore other rooms to find relevant information.
ACTION: go to kitchen
INFO - Agent Action: go to kitchen
INFO - Observation: You move to the kitchen.
INFO - Score: 1
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since I'm now in the kitchen, I should look around to see if there are any objects, notes, or books that could provide information about pea plant genetics or the location of the blue and orange boxes.

	a cupboard. The cupboard door is closed. 
	a freezer. The freezer door is closed. 
	a fridge. The fridge door is closed. 
	a glass jar (containing a substance called sodium chloride)
	a lighter

	a stopwatch, which is deactivated. 
	a stove, which is turned off. On the stove is: nothing.
	a table. On the table is: a glass cup (containing nothing).
	a thermometer, currently reading a temperature of 10 degrees celsius
You also see:
	A door to the bathroom (that is open)
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
	A door to the outside (that is open)
INFO - Score: 1
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The kitchen doesn't seem to have any direct information about pea plant genetics, so I should explore other rooms, possibly starting with the hallway, to find relevant information or the blue and orange boxes.
ACTION: go to hallway
INFO - Agent Action: go to hallway
INFO - Observation: You move to the hallway.
INFO - Score: 1
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since I'm in the hallway, I should look around to see if there are any objects, notes, or doors that could lead me to information about pea plant genetics or the location of the blue and orange boxes.
ACTION: look around
INFO - Agent Action: look around
INFO - Observation: This room is called the hallway. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a finger painting
You also see:
	A door to the art studio (that is open)
	A door to the bedroom (that is open)
	A door to the greenhouse (that is open)
	A door to the kitchen (that is open)
	A door to the living room (that is open)
	A door to the workshop (that is open)
INFO - Score: 1
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The greenhouse seems like the most relevant location to find information about pea plant genetics, as it's a place where plants are typically grown and studied.
ACTION: go to greenhouse
INFO - Agent Action: go to greenhouse
INFO - Observation: You move to the greenhouse.
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since I'm now in the greenhouse, I should look around to see if there are any pea plants, notes, or books that could provide information about the genetics of round seed shape.
ACTION: look around
INFO - Agent Action: look around
INFO - Observation: This room is called the greenhouse. In it, you see: 
	the agent
	a substance called air
	a bee hive. The bee hive door is closed. 
	a blue box (containing nothing)
	a flower pot 2 (containing soil, a substance called water)
	a flower pot 4 (containing soil, a substance called water)
	a flower pot 5 (containing soil, a substance called water)
	a flower pot 6 (containing soil, a substance called water)
	a flower pot 8 (containing soil, a substance called water)
	a flower pot 9 (containing soil, a substance called water)
	a jug (containing nothing)
	a orange box (containing nothing)
	a seed jar (containing a wrinkly green pea seed, a round green pea seed)
	a shovel
	a sink, which is turned off. In the sink is: nothing.
You also see:
	A door to the hallway (that is open)
	A door to the outside (that is open)
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: The seed jar contains both a wrinkly green pea seed and a round green pea seed, which suggests that I can find information about the genetics of pea plant seed shape here, possibly by examining the seeds or looking for notes.
ACTION: look at seed jar
INFO - Agent Action: look at seed jar
INFO - Observation: a seed jar (containing a wrinkly green pea seed, a round green pea seed)
INFO - Score: 17
INFO - Done: False
INFO - ---------------------------------
INFO - Agent Output: THOUGHT: Since the seed jar contains both a wrinkly and a round pea seed, and given the basic principles of Mendelian genetics, I can infer that the round seed shape is likely the dominant trait because it's often the case that round shapes are dominant over wrinkly shapes in pea plants.
ACTION: focus on blue box
INFO - Agent Action: focus on blue box
INFO - Observation: You focus on the blue box.
INFO - Score: 100
INFO - Done: True
